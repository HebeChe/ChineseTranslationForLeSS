# Y SOFT的组织设计进化 Evolving Y Soft’s Organizational Design

Y Soft自2019年开始导入LeSS。与其他企业LeSS导入不同，Y Soft不仅实施了一系列重要的*组织设计*（OD）变革，而且它基于学习不断<u>调整前期所做的变革</u>。 正是这种动态调整，是企业达成自适应，并让Scrum或LeSS真正运作的前提条件。组织设计常常需要通过实验来不断学习和*进化*。因此，本学习案例的主题是LeSS之旅中组织设计元素的*进化*。

Y Soft adopted LeSS in 2019. A differentiator of Y Soft’s LeSS adoption was not only making significant *organizational design* (OD) changes, but then also <u>changing the changes</u> based on learning. Such changes are a prerequisite for being adaptive and hence making Scrum or LeSS work. Learning and *evolving* in OD is often needed based on experience. Therefore, a theme of this case study is the *evolution* of their OD elements in their LeSS journey.

本文每个章节都描述了LeSS导入过程中组织设计变革的一次实验。每部分结构类似，如下：
1. 背景
2. 详述
3. 检视：反思近期的组织设计变革
4. 适应：调整变革
  

Each section describes an experiment of an OD change in the LeSS adoption. It is structured as:

1. Context
2. Narrative
3. Inspection: reflection on recent OD changes
4. Adaptation: changing the changes

我（Mark - 主要作者）在Y Soft的LeSS导入中扮演的角色是在他们LeSS导入进行了整一年之后（2020年1月）作为唯一的外部咨询师提供LeSS导入的现场指导和改进。一年多后（2021年春天），我的工作转变为对Scrum Master提供支持和辅导（每周1-2天），Scrum Master则主要面向产品和团队，为他们提供支持，这种职责模式一直持续到2022年夏天。本案例讲述范围从2018年LeSS准备期开始，一直到2021年底。

My role (Mark - main author) in the LeSS adoption at Y Soft was the on-site coaching and improvement of the LeSS adoption after exactly one year (January 2020) into the LeSS adoption as the only external consultant. After over a year (Spring 2021), it became a more supporting and mentoring role (1-2 days a week) towards the Scrum Masters that support the product and the teams, until summer 2022. The scope of this case study is from the start of the preparation in 2018 until late 2021.

本案例结束处的附录包含了一些有趣但次要的话题 - Y Soft在技术卓越上改进的相关实验，以及一些关键的准备事件。
This study ends with interesting but secondary-topic appendices on Y Soft’s related experiments with improving technical excellence, and some key preparation events.

## 产品 Product

*作为这个案例学习的背景，本章节介绍了Y Soft的产品SAFEQ，该产品被<u>自2018到2021年底</u>的LeSS导入所覆盖。自那以后，Y Soft的产品投资组合发生了变化和拓展，Y Soft在2022年收购了EveryonePrint。与之相关的研发并不在本章节中体现。关于Y Soft和其产品的最新信息，请访问 ysoft.com。*

*This section describes the status of the product involving the LeSS adoption at Y Soft, YSoft SAFEQ, in the timeframe from <u>2018 to late 2021</u>, for context of this case study. Since then, Y Soft’s portfolio has changed and extended, and Y Soft acquired EveryonePrint in 2022. These developments are not taken into account in this section. For the latest information about Y Soft and its products, visit ysoft.com.*

SAFEQ针对不同的打印设备提供不同的打印管理方案。大型打印机供应商把SAFEQ安装在其设备上，与客户直接交互。对大部分客户来说，SAFEQ是无感的。

SAFEQ has a series of Print Management solutions for print devices. Big printer vendors have SAFEQ installed on their devices and are in direct contact with customers. For most customers, it’s unknown that they use SAFEQ.

SAFEQ的客户与供应商遍布全球，他们的需求也因地方/国家的战略或法规的不同而不同。因此，针对一个特性功能经常会有全球化实施还是本地实施的权衡考量，以及哪些需求应该作为产品长期战略的决策讨论。供应商与客户选择Y Soft合作的主要原因是他们灵活的适应性以及快速交付创新功能的能力。

SAFEQ has customers and vendors worldwide and their requirements might be different based on local/country strategies or regulations. Therefore, there is a constant trade-off between implementing features globally or locally and choosing which of those requirements are desired to be in the long-term strategy of the product. One of the key points why vendors & customers want to collaborate with Y Soft is their adaptability and speed to deliver new and innovative features.

不同的打印机供应商以及不同市场的客户需求，导致了SAFEQ产品的复杂性。此外，供应商在许多不同的设备上都会嵌入该软件，这些设备间有时仅仅有轻微的差异，但是即使是这种轻微的差异，也会对SAFEQ的安装带来很大的影响。在本案例发生期间，大部分客户是要求本地安装的(*说明: 也是从那时起，越来越多的客户开始转向基于云的打印管理方案了*)，因此，Y Soft和供应商有较多的接触，如果需要，也会对客户提供直接安装和支持服务。这类协作一般发生在和本地客户部门之间，如果遇到客户部门无法解决的问题，也会和研发部门对接。在案例发生时，Y Soft正在向云端产品演进，这可以简化实施的复杂度。

SAFEQ complexity comes from different features that different print vendors and customers (in different markets) need. Additionally, vendors are using software in  many - sometimes only slightly - different devices. But even small differences in devices have big consequences for the SAFEQ installation. At the time of the case study, most installations for customers are on-premise (*note: since then, more and more customers have a cloud-based print management solution*), and therefore there is a lot of contact with vendors, and if needed, customers for installation, support etc. Collaboration happens mostly with (local) customer departments, and R&D will be involved when customer departments can’t solve the problems. At the time of the case study, Y Soft is moving to a cloud-based product, which simplifies this complexity.

在下面的章节中，我将会逐步介绍发生在2018年中到2021年底的Y Soft的LeSS敏捷之旅。也许还会有针对此后改变的后续案例学习。想了解最新进展，请回看[Y Soft在2023柏林LeSS大会上的演讲](https://less.works/conferenza/sessions/2023-less-conference-berlin-y-soft-case-study-huge-less-without-less-huge-316)。

In the upcoming sections, the different steps of Y Soft’s LeSS journey are explained, step by step from mid 2018 until late 2021. Perhaps there will be a subsequent case study about the steps after this. More info about the latest developments, watch back the [Y Soft talk at the 2023 LeSS conference in Berlin](https://less.works/conferenza/sessions/2023-less-conference-berlin-y-soft-case-study-huge-less-without-less-huge-316).


## 0. 在LeSS导入之前 Before the LeSS Adoption

### 0.1 背景 Context

以瀑布式产品研发为起点，Y Soft开始尝试“敏捷产品交付”，然而这只是一个他们新工作方式的名字而已，和敏捷与产品交付几乎没有关系。他们重组了9个*组件*团队，每个团队设置一个架构师作为“产品负责人”！至少需要4个“迭代”才能交付一个特性，而且没有任何团队可以独立交付特性。说明一下，这并不是真正的“迭代”，由于是组件团队（非特性团队），“迭代”的产出物往往是一些组件任务和不完整的特性，而不是真正的初衷：每个迭代输出一个可交付的产品。各种不同的角色（如项目经理、销售、市场营销）都可以直接与研发沟通，打断他们当前的工作，并要求他们着手新功能的开发。为了解决在交付客户特性方面遇到的挑战，Y Soft公司的研发副总裁（VP）成立了一个产品管理委员会。他们负责产品级的决策，决定团队要开发的特性。这导致了一个过度管控、几乎没有任何适应性的流程，并且对于正在发生的事情也没有增加多少透明度。此外，那些想要实现某特性或变更的人仍然利用他们与团队经理和开发者的关系来达成他们的目标，完全超越流程之外。这证明了*简便办法*（成立产品委员会）*往往会“自食其果”*，甚至有可能让事情变得更糟。

Coming from waterfall-based product development, Y Soft started trying “agile product delivery”, a name they gave to their new way of working that had little to do with agility or product delivery. They re-organized into 9 *component* teams with an architect as “Product Owner” per team! it took at least 4 “Sprints” to get one feature delivered, while no team would be able to deliver this feature independently. Note that these were fake “Sprints”, since with component teams (rather than feature teams) the result of a “Sprint” is often just a set of component tasks and hence incomplete features rather than the true intention: a shippable product every Sprint. Many different roles (e.g. project managers, sales, marketing) approached and interrupted developers directly to work on features. To address the challenges with delivering customer features, Y Soft’s Vice President (VP) of R&D installed a product governance committee. They made decisions on product level and decided on features that teams needed to develop. This resulted in a heavily governed process with virtually no adaptiveness, and which didn’t give much transparency to what was going on. Additionally, people that wanted a feature or change used their connections with team managers and developers to get things done outside of the process. This demonstrated that the *easy way out* (by installing a product governance committee) *usually leads back in* and probably worsened the situation.

### 0.2 详述 Narrative

第一次尝试特性团队是在产品的扫描领域，这是一个对客户来讲比较直观的业务领域。两个组件团队和来自测试与发布的人员共同组成了一个特性团队，并开始更接近真正Scrum的尝试。虽然*没有进行大规模的组织变革* - 组织变革是Scrum的隐性要求，但也实施了一些细微的调整，使团队能够以这种方式工作。这也导致我们雇佣了第一位Scrum Master来帮助推动变革。该特性团队首次尝试增量迭代的开发模式，每1到2个迭代给客户做一次产品增量交付。这让团队可以和客户更紧密的合作。因为有更快速的反馈，在开发人员和客户之间不再有中间人的角色，这种协作模式帮助了团队交付客户真正想要的需求，并避免构建“臆想”的功能。基于学习则增加了适应。在特性团队的尝试过程中，研发部门的产品总监（也是SAFEQ产品下全部团队主管的领导）也做了一些*微小*的管理组织架构变革：他指定了一个经理负责整个特性团队，而不再是三个经理（两个组件团队经理和一个测试经理）。这是管理层逐步向支持性角色转变的首次尝试。同时，这次实验还取消了团队主管角色。

The first attempt of a feature team was in the scanning area of the product, a recognizable area for customers. Two component teams and people from testing & releasing were merged together into one feature team and started something closer to actual Scrum. There were *no big organizational changes* involved yet, as implicitly required by Scrum, but a few changes were there to enable the team to work this way. This also led to hiring the first Scrum Master that helped in this change. The team did a first attempt for incremental & iterative development with delivery every 1 or 2 Sprints to customers. This enabled the team to work closer with customers. The collaboration helped the team to deliver the right things and avoid building the wrong things, because there was faster feedback and no middlemen in between the developers and customers. There was some increase in adapting based on learning. With this attempt for a feature team, the Head of Product within R&D (who was the manager of the team leads for all SAFEQ teams) also did a *minor* organizational change in the management structure: instead of three managers (from the two component teams and one testing team) for the new team, he selected one manager for the whole feature team. This was a first shift of management’s behavior towards a more supportive role. The experiment also led to the removal of team lead positions.

扫描试点后来被认为是整个研发组织“应该的做事方式”。但是，由于当前的组织架构，以及不同的领导和专家依旧希望保持他们的权利现状，导致一些*关键*因素被忽略，比如真正的跨组件、跨职能团队。简而言之，相比真正的特性团队，他们导入了一系列较小的实践改变，而非深度的组织设计变革，但只有深度组织变革才能在适应性、前置时间和客户满意这些维度带来较大收益。因此，Y Soft只收获了一些较小的改进，所以他们仍旧在寻找更好的方式去应对挑战。

The scanning example was thereafter considered “the way to do it” across the entire R&D organization. However, due to the existing structure of the organization, and also the desire of various managers and specialists to stay in their status quo power structures, several *critical* factors were actually ignored, such as truly cross-component, cross-functional teams. In short, rather than real feature teams, they adopted trivial practice changes rather than the deep organizational design changes that would actually bring a large benefit in terms of adaptiveness, lead time, and customer delight. Therefore only a few minor things improved, and so Y Soft still looked for better ways to address their challenges.

#### 0.2.1 组织设计元素 Organizational design elements

在LeSS导入前，Y Soft在小范围尝试了一些组织设计元素实验，这些尝试并未对更大的组织产生影响。这些组织设计元素对敏捷有一定积极正面的作用，但是在没有必要的*更大规模*组织设计变革做支撑的前提下，并不会带来大的影响改变。总结一下，在一个团队所做的一个实验中涉及的组织设计元素包括： 
* LeSS规则：每个团队是 (1) 自管理的，（2） 跨职能的，（3） 同在一地的，（4）长期的
* LeSS实验：尝试...通过消除“完成外”的工作来消除“完成外”的单元
* LeSS实验：尝试...工作再设计

Before the LeSS adoption, Y Soft experimented with a few OD elements on a small scale, which didn’t affect the larger organization. These OD elements had some minor effects on the agility, but couldn’t bring the larger impacts without the needed *larger* OD changes. In short, the OD-elements that were involved in a single experiment with a single team were:

* LeSS Rule: Each team is (1) self-managing, (2) cross-functional, (3) co-located, and (4) long-lived.
* LeSS experiment: Try…Eliminating the ‘Undone’ unit by eliminating ‘Undone’ work
* LeSS experiment: Try…Work redesign

全部这些组织设计元素都是有一定局限性的，因为单团队的 *外围组织* 并*未发生改变*。相比之前，团队变得更加跨职能了，成员都在同一地，且更加长期稳定。但是，自管理是很难的，因为他们在没有帮助的前提下无法独立交付工作增量。而且他们只能从他们有限的视角出发去端到端地交付以客户为中心的特性，而不是从整个产品的视角。即便如此，从他们的小视角来看，之前被组织在“完成外”单元的工作再设计和功能整合，确实也带来了一些微小的收益。关于组织设计元素的更多说明请参考第一个组织设计实验的 [组织设计元素章节](#125-organizational-design-elements)。

All of these OD elements were limited, because the *organization around* the single team *didn’t change*. The team was more cross-functional, co-located and stayed long together. However, it was hard to self-manage, because they couldn’t deliver a working increment without help. And their ability to deliver end-to-end customer-centric features was only from their perspective, but not from the whole product’s perspective. However, from the small perspective they had, there were some minor benefits, work redesign and functions integrated that were organized in an ‘Undone’ unit before for their perspective. More explanation about these OD elements in the [OD elements section](#125-organizational-design-elements) of the first OD experiment.

### 0.3 检视

第一个特性团队的尝试以及进一步推广的失败，导致Y Soft的人员开始寻找外部的信息资料来弄清楚如何继续他们的Scrum导入。他们初尝了Scrum的益处，但是在没有*必要的组织变革*支撑下，他们无法收获到Scrum能够带来的全部收益。他们通过Google搜索找到了LeSS官网，并参加了当地的敏捷社区和活动，这引发了他们对LeSS的真正兴趣。特别是Jürgen De Smet在2016年布拉格敏捷大会上的演讲 [“组织是如何失控的”](https://youtu.be/QkGyVKl9CGE)，深深地吸引了他们。


The first feature team attempt and the failed expansion feature teams led people in Y Soft to search for additional external information to find out how to move forward with their Scrum adoption(s). They found the first benefits of Scrum, but were unable to gather the benefits that it could bring without *the needed organizational changes*. They found the LeSS website through Google Search, and people participated in local agile communities and events which led to some genuine interest in LeSS. Especially the presentation by Jürgen De Smet at [Agile Prague 2016: “How organizations go nuts”](https://youtu.be/QkGyVKl9CGE) caught their interest in LeSS.

### 0.4 适应

早期变革的VP支持者一开始没有完全接受LeSS，他和另一位VP决定一起参加2018年2月份的CLP培训课程。这成为他们真正认可LeSS是前行之路的开始。

The supporting VP of earlier changes wasn’t completely convinced about LeSS and decided to attend a public Certified LeSS Practitioner (CLP) in February 2018 together with another VP. This became the start of truly considering LeSS as the way forward.

在审视可行的LeSS导入方案时，Y Soft的研发人员意识到这是一场需要外部支持的变革。在2018年4月左右，因为在CLP中的积极体验，他们联系了[Jürgen De Smet](https://less.works/profiles/jurgen-de-smet)请求合作。此外，他们给董事会提交了一份LeSS导入的预算提案，包括为什么要变革，以及可能的成功指标。董事会最终在2018年5月底通过了这项提案，这样同年6月LeSS导入得以正式启动。这也触发了*第一个重要组织设计变革*的准备工作。

Examining a possible LeSS adoption, the people in Y Soft R&D realized this was a kind of change where they would need external support for. They contacted [Jürgen De Smet](https://less.works/profiles/jurgen-de-smet) with a request for collaboration around April 2018, because of their positive experiences from the CLP. Together, they crafted a budget proposal for the LeSS adoption towards the board, including the why of the change and possible success metrics. The board approved the proposal by the end of May 2018, which initiated the LeSS adoption activities to start in June 2018. This led to the preparation of the *first major organizational design changes*.

## 1. 实验1 组织设计：有多个特性团队的单个产品 Experiment 1 Organizational Design: A Single product with feature teams

### 1.1 背景 Context

产品总监决定导入LeSS，设定了未来的一个时间来组织一场为期四天的活动，以遵循LeSS导入指南*启动*里的步骤建议，确保一个合适的开始。他们把这称为他们的“LeSS翻转向前”活动。产品总监与市场团队（研发之外）选定了一个具体的产品以及清晰的范围可以有效践行“深而窄”，以遵循*“深而窄”优于“浅而宽”*的LeSS导入原则。通过为期4天的活动，组织一次性完成了*结构变革（组织和产品）*。

The Head of Product decided to start the LeSS adoption and set a time in the future to have a 4-day event to follow the LeSS adoption guide *Getting Started* and follow the steps of the guide to make a proper start. They called this their ‘LeSS Flip-forward’ event. The Head of Product with product marketing (outside R&D) chose a specific product and clear scope for it to go ‘deep & narrow’, following the LeSS adoption principle *deep & narrow over broad & shallow*. The 4-day event was used to do the *structural change (organizationally & product)* at once.

### 1.2 详述 Narrative

Y Soft高管选择Co-Learning咨询公司（现在名为Simplification Officers）作为LeSS导入的合作伙伴。Y Soft内部LeSS支持者（Scrum Master、开发人员和部分中层管理者）主动承担了LeSS导入和工作坊的准备工作，他们一起梳理现状与挑战，学习探讨必要的变革（参考下面章节）。这样一来，内部人员成为变革的真正主人，这是获得变革成功和能真正主导变革的一个关键因素。外部知识则被用作指导和知识库。

Y Soft senior management chose Co-Learning (today known as Simplification Officers) as their partner in the LeSS adoption. The Y Soft internal supporters (Scrum Masters, developers and some middle managers) that volunteered to help prepare the LeSS adoption and the workshops came together to understand the current situation, challenges and learn what changes are needed (see following sections). This way, the internal people could take ownership of the change itself, which is a key factor of making a successful change and really owning the change. External knowledge is then used as guidance and a knowledge base.

#### 1.2.1 LeSS导入准备 Preparation for the LeSS adoption

准备工作以从不同视角分析Y Soft研发背景开始，包括组织、工作流程、实际代码的技术健康度。远程准备的目标是了解Y Soft现状，让Y Soft和Co-Learning（作为LeSS导入的合作伙伴）都获得更好的理解，并一起学习确定下一步任务与方向。分析采用了以下方式：

* 诸如Confluence、ERP这类内部工具的分析用以组织评估。
* 通过分析代码、构建和部署计划、分支管理策略和架构文档来评价技术健康度。

An analysis of the Y Soft R&D context from different perspectives started the preparation: organizational, work processes and technical health of the actual code. The goal of the remote preparation is to learn about the current state of Y Soft, to acquire a better understanding for both Y Soft and Co-Learning (as the partner in the LeSS adoption) and to learn together about next steps. In the analysis were taken along:

* Analysis of internal tools like Confluence & ERP for the organizational assessment
* Evaluation of the technical health by analyzing the code, build- and deployment plans, branching strategies and architectural documentation


技术健康度评估被用于和开发人员一起确认并学习如何改进。例如，开发团队吸取的一个学习点是，要确保只有个别人员具备的知识点（特定组件或技术）能在团队自设计过程中被散布到多个团队，并确保团队成员都有机会学习这类知识。

The technical health evaluation was used to validate and learn with the developers how to improve. An example  learning point that developers took, is to make sure that the knowledge of people that are the single points of knowledge (of certain components or technologies) would be spread amongst teams in the team self-design and to make sure team members could learn this knowledge.


在LeSS导入准备过程中，下述初始评估结果被指出：

* 对于相对小的组织来说，存在较多的管理层级
* 没有明确的产品负责人 - 有“团队PO”，架构师和项目经理，然而这些角色在Scrum中是不存在的
* 长期处于救火状态，追求表面的完成状态
* Jira工作流中存在很多状态与员工实际工作不匹配
* 大约有75份显式的待办列表
* 总共有898个构建计划，最长构建时间25小时，50个构建计划处于持续失败中
* 发布很困难，需要很多时间，因为每个团队只关注一个特定部分，围绕一个或多个组件

The following results from the initial evaluation were addressed in the preparation of the LeSS adoption:

* Many management layers for a reasonably small organization
* No clear Product Owner - there are “team PO’s”, architects and project managers while these roles don’t exist in Scrum
* In a constant state of firefighting and checkbox hunting
* Jira workflows with more status differences than employees working with it
* +/- 75 explicit backlogs
* 898 build plans in total, maximum build time 25 hours, 50 build plans in continuous failure
* Releasing was difficult and took a lot of time, since each team focused on a specific part around (a) component(s)

这些评估结果在工作坊中被确认，并作为为期4天的工作坊的输入。

The results were validated in workshops and taken as preparation for the 4-day event’s workshops.

LeSS指南*启动*的第一步是：全员培训。VP和Scrum Master全都参加了Jürgen de Smet的CLP课程，从而更深刻地理解LeSS。对全部工程师，以及一些潜在的LeSS导入志愿者，我们组织了一轮通往一个LeSS组织的乐高Scrum工作坊（Lego 4 Scrum）。为了挑选出合适的志愿者，以及确定适合他们参与的领域，Jürgen把工作坊组织得十分激烈。重点放在让大家理解与其他团队、客户以及用户的协作是极其重要的。

The first step of the LeSS guide *Getting Started* is: educate everyone. The VP’s and Scrum Masters all joined Jürgen de Smet’s CLP to get a deeper understanding of LeSS. For all developers - and some others - potentially volunteering in the LeSS adoption, there was a Lego 4 Scrum workshop towards a LeSS organization. Jürgen made the workshop very intense, to really get the right volunteers and to know where they would sign up for. Emphasis is to understand it’s extremely important to collaborate with other teams, customers and users.

#### 1.2.2 初始组织改进Kata（2018年8月） Initial Organizational Improvement Kata (August 2018)

基于前期准备的结果，按照Toyota Kata方法，掀起了一场组织改进Kata活动。设定的方向与挑战是，在为期4天的活动之后找到最适合开启LeSS导入的组织结构。

Based on the results from the preparation, an Organizational Improvement Kata was organized, based on the Toyota Kata approach. The direction and challenge that was set forward was to find the optimal organizational structure for starting in the LeSS adoption after the 4-day event.

现状的积极之处：
* 聚焦组件，在组件上具备较深的知识积累
* 所有请求都归集于产品
* 用户体验与安全知识在研发内
* 关注支持工作
* 大量的内部知识

Positive about the current situation:

* Component focus and deep knowledge of components
* Product is a central point for all requests
* UX & Security knowledge is within R&D
* Focus on support
* Lot of internal knowledge

对现状的改进项：
* 团队间互相等待较多
* 产品级的构建流水线不能有效的工作
* 几乎收不到来自现场的反馈
* 从现场到团队没有直接的信息流
* 传递给团队的需求并不是客户真正想要的
* 角色职责定义不清
* 支持工作会打断新需求开发
* 升级会经过不同的的渠道
* 文档不健全

Improvements for the current situation:

* Teams wait for each other a lot
* The build pipeline doesn’t work well on product level
* Almost no feedback back from the field
* No direct information flow to teams from the field
* Requests that go to the teams are not what the customer actually wanted
* No clarity for roles
* Support interrupts new development
* Escalations go through different channels
* Documentation is not right

一个被选定的小组使用“Management3.0”中的Meddlers游戏来设计未来的组织状态。他们探索了多个选项，对喜欢的模式进一步优化，并消除大多数（并非全部）不喜欢的模式。

A selected group was working to design a future state using the Meddlers Game from Management 3.0. They  explored options to elevate the favorable patterns discovered and eliminate most (not to say all) less favorable patterns.

在组织重新设计后，继续由这个小组决定产品是什么。定义产品是LeSS指南*启动*的第二步。通过“全员培训”的志愿者们被加入进来对组织设计结果给予反馈。这个小组成员一起做了一个*特性团队导入地图*练习。LeSS指南*特性团队导入地图*有助于可视化LeSS导入过程中组织变革的演进路径。*特性团队导入地图*在一个轴上展示团队工作范围逐渐变大，在另一个轴上展示团队跨职能的程度逐步加深。这带来了组织设置上的洞见，并由此确定了启动LeSS导入的4天活动的边界范围。

The same group defined together what ‘product’ could mean in the context of the new organizational setup. Define product is the second step in the LeSS guide *Getting Started*. Volunteers from the ‘educate everyone’ session were added to get feedback on the results for the organizational setup. The whole group did a *Feature Team Adoption Map* exercise. This LeSS guide *Feature Team Adoption Maps* helps to make transparent the kind of organizational change you can expect for the LeSS adoption. It’s a representation of the gradually increasing work scope of the teams on one axis and the degree of cross-functionality of teams on the other axis.  It resulted in insights on the organizational setup and to set boundaries of what is in scope for the 4-day event that starts the LeSS adoption.

一个重要发现是没有人想做新定义产品的产品负责人。

An important observation was that nobody wanted to be the Product Owner for the newly defined product.

#### 1.2.3 准备为期4天的LeSS启动活动 Preparing the 4-day event starting the LeSS adoption

在Y Soft，VP和Scrum Master主导了4天启动活动的准备。并没有因此专门成立一个变革小组，全部活动组织的职责都由志愿者承担。志愿者们每周两次同步进展，并讨论下一步工作计划。

Within Y Soft, the VP and the Scrum Masters took the lead to further prepare the 4-day event. There was no official change team and the responsibilities for all activities were taken by volunteers. The volunteers met twice a week to synchronize on progress and discuss and plan next steps.

活动之一是成立了社区（也称为“实践社区”），以便团队之间能够协作、一起共同设计和知识分享。LeSS指南*社区*就是为了解决跨团队事宜，比如技能、标准、工具和设计。推荐的社区包括设计/架构社区和测试社区。开发人员有时会被要求成立他们认为有用的社区，这也导致了许多无实际作用的社区。

One activity was to set up communities (AKA ‘Communities of Practice’) to be able to coordinate between teams, work together on designs and share knowledge between teams. The LeSS guide *Communities* is there to address cross-team concerns about e.g. skills, standards, tools and designs. Recommended communities include design/architecture and test. Developers were asked to set up communities they thought were useful, which resulted in many “communities” without any real impact.

此外，外部支持也常被用来组织一些深度的技术工作坊。在事件风暴（Event Stroming）工作坊中，志愿者们把他们的（技术）架构链接回业务场景。团队需要从聚焦组件转变为聚焦整个产品，而且这些洞见能够帮助团队更好地理解产品。另外，有一个内部代码静修（Code retreat）工作坊活动，专注于小步重构来引入一些必要的工程实践，以帮助团队向前发展。人们可以在他们团队里使用工作坊中学到的知识。通过这种方式，他们可以实现将全部组件集成为一个产品，包括支持、发布和其他活动。

Additionally external support was used to organize several in-depth technical workshops. In an event-storming workshop, volunteers linked their (technical) architecture back to business context. Teams had to move from a component focus to a whole-product focus, and these insights helped teams to better understand that whole product. Additionally, there was an internal code retreat on baby-step refactoring to bring in some necessary engineering practices for teams to move ahead. People could use the learnings of this workshop in their teams. This way, they could integrate all components in one product, including support, releasing and other activities.

准备工作中一项重要的活动是寻找产品负责人。通过内部搜索与沟通，产品营销VP担任了产品负责人的角色，这与1993年在Easel首次Scrum导入时类似。他所负责部门的产品营销人员可以帮助团队获得必要的客户理解。

One of the crucial activities that was needed in the preparation was to find a Product Owner. After searching and discussing this internally, the VP of product marketing took the role of Product Owner, as in the very first Scrum adoption at Easel in 1993. The people in his department from product marketing would help teams to get the needed customer understanding.

#### 1.2.4 4天活动开启LeSS导入 The 4-day event starting the LeSS adoption

在2019年1月进行了为期4天的启动活动。所有能参与的志愿者都会参加，包括产品负责人，管理层和其他一些支持角色。产品总监向大家介绍了LeSS变革的原因。
In January of 2019, the 4-day event took place. All possible volunteers would join, including the Product Owner, management and some other supporting roles. The Head of Product explained to everyone the reason for the change in the introduction.

##### 第一天：初始PBR（Product Backlog Refinement/产品待办列表梳理） Day 1: initial Product Backlog Refinement (initial PBR)

作为初始产品待办列表梳理的第一步，产品负责人分享了产品愿景。LeSS指南*初始PBR*是确保让团队有一份产品待办列表，里面有足够的已经理解的产品待办条目可以开始工作。在开始导入LeSS时做梳理非常重要，因为通常现有的所谓“产品待办列表”遵循旧的组织结构，往往是职能或者组件导向的，而不是客户导向的。在特性团队模式下，产品待办条目（PBIs）会是客户导向的，因此原“产品待办列表”经常会失效，但是可以作为初始PBR的输入。在说明初始PBR非常重要的众多其它原因中，最关键的是通过PBR能确保团队充分理解产品待办条目，而不是由某个人、某个团队或其他人写下每个条目，并假设其他人都能正确理解这些条目。

The Product Owner shared the product vision as a starting point for initial Product Backlog Refinement. The LeSS guide *Initial PBR* is to make sure that teams have a Product Backlog with enough understood items to start working. It’s important to do at the start of a LeSS adoption, because usually the so-called “Product Backlogs” that exist follow the old structure, often functional or component focused instead of customer-focused. With feature teams, the Product Backlog Items (PBI’s) will be customer-focused and therefore the old “Product Backlogs” will often not be useful, but can be a good source for the initial PBR. Among several other reasons why initial PBR is important, it’s needed to make sure teams understand the PBI’s, instead of having PBI’s written down by one person, team or someone else and assuming others understand it.

产品愿景是初始PBR的起点，该活动应全员参与。工程师们创建一个集市，大家以每个条目大约6人的方式一起工作。大家会进行多轮迭代讨论，每轮后彼此互相分享结果，这个过程有些类似LeSS迭代评审集市，但仅仅是条目的分析，而非完成特性的展示。在完成多轮迭代梳理后，多个组会“群体编写文档”（Mob documenting），把梳理结果更新到Wiki和产品待办列表中。完成这个工作后，团队开始估算梳理好的产品待办条目。

The product vision was the starting point for the initial PBR, done together by all participants. Engineers created a marketplace, and worked together with around 6 people per item. People worked in several iterations, and after each iteration, people shared the results to each other in something like a LeSS Sprint Review Bazaar, but only for item analysis, not for done features. After the Refinement iterations, groups of people did ‘mob documenting’, where they added the results of the Refinement to the Wiki and the Product Backlog. After this, the group did estimation on the refinement PBI’s.

More elaboration on the activities of the 4-day event can be found in [this Appendix](#appendix-b-preparation-to-the-4-day-events-that-kicked-off-the-less-adoption).

##### 第二天：创建完成的定义 & 自设计团队 Day 2: Creating the Definition of Done & self-design the team

每个人都参与了“完成的定义”工作坊，从而建立起一个面向产品的统一的完成定义（DoD）。基于LeSS指南*创建完成的定义*，这需要在第一个迭代开始前完成。参会者们经历重新分组，并借助LeSS指南*跨团队会议*中的引导技术，整个团队通过若干“发散再合并”的周期最终形成一份DoD。

Everyone participated in a Definition of Done workshop, to get to a common Definition of Done (DoD) for the product. According to the LeSS guide *Creating the Definition of Done*, it was created before the first Sprint started. Participants re-grouped and with facilitation techniques from the LeSS guide *Cross-Team Meetings*, the entire group ended up with 1 DoD with diverge-merge cycles.


在这之后，大家组织了一场“完成外”工作坊来探索哪些活动能在每个迭代内完成（遵循LeSS指南*创建完成的定义*）。大家将那些不在DoD中的活动 - 意味着团队还不能“完成”这些活动 - 分配到各个小组中。每个小组定义这些活动将如何被完成（何时、何地和做什么），从而识别出为达到一个“完美”DoD并能交付产品给客户所需的所有遗漏项。团队将在未来使用这个“完成外的定义”去完善DoD。这给了团队透明度，使他们知道需要和谁去紧密协作来完成什么。同时也给团队提供了如何处理（某种类型）“完成外”工作的洞见，以及未来改进DoD的机会。

After that, they did an ‘undone’ workshop to discover which activities can be done each Sprint (following the LeSS guide *Creating the Definition of Done*). People divided activities that weren’t on the DoD - meaning teams weren’t able to get that ‘done’ - into the groups. Each group defined how the activities will get done (when, where & what) to identify all the missing pieces to get to a ‘perfect’ DoD and to be able to ship the product to customers. Teams would use this Definition of Undone to improve the DoD in the future. It gave teams transparency with whom to collaborate closely about what. This gave the teams insight into how to deal with (certain types of) ‘undone’ work and what opportunities there are to improve the DoD in the future.

然后，大家“焚烧”了他们的旧团队。大家制作了关于当前团队以及对他们意味着什么的资料。他们真的焚烧了这些资料，作为对过去团队的告别，从而能够以全新心态去设计新团队。

Then, people ‘burned’ their old teams. Teams made materials about their current teams and what it meant to them. They literally burned these materials, as a way of saying goodbye to the old teams and being able to design the new teams with a fresh mind.

在这之后，团队自设计工作坊开始了。LeSS导入原则之一是*采用志愿者*模式鼓励吸引人们参与，这让大家有被授权的感觉。其中重要的一个部分是自设计团队，也就是让大家自己决定未来团队是什么样子。自设计团队的标准包括：
* 团队位于在同一地点
* 团队规模在6到10人
* 能够尽可能多地独立交付PBIs
* 团队成员能力和性格的多样性

Then, the team self-design workshop started. One of the LeSS adoption principles is *Use volunteering*, to engage people and it gives people the feeling of being empowered. An important part of this is to self-design the teams, meaning to let people decide themselves how the team looks like. The criteria for the self-design for the teams were:

* Team is co-located
* Size is between 6 and 10 people
* Being able to deliver as much PBI’s independently as possible
* High diversity of skills and personalities

在工作坊开始前，我们宣布只有希望成为团队成员的志愿者（遵循*采用志愿者*的导入原则）、Scrum Master和管理者们可以留在房间里，因为他们将是在新环境中一起工作的主要人员。其他人被要求离开。一些架构师离开了，因为他们决定不加入团队。每个志愿者填写了一份模板“个人特征表”。这包括个人能力、技术能力和其他一些想要加进表格的重要信息。这个表格在后续的团队自设计迭代中会频繁用到。经过三轮迭代后，全部团队成员至少对团队设置表示"可以"，这意味着初始团队已经确定形成了。

Before starting the workshop, it was announced that only volunteers that want to be a team member (following the *Use Volunteering* adoption principle), Scrum Masters and managers could stay in the room, because they are the ones that are going to work together primarily in the new setting. All other people were requested to leave. Some architects were leaving and decided not to be part of a team. Each volunteer filled in a template ‘personal character sheet’. They included personal skills, technology skills and other important things that they wanted to add to their sheet. This sheet was used in each iteration of the team self-design subsequently. After three iterations, all team members were at least ‘ok’ with the team setup and that meant that the initial teams were final.

More elaboration on the activities of the 4-day event can be found in [this Appendix](#appendix-b-preparation-to-the-4-day-events-that-kicked-off-the-less-adoption).

##### 第三天：团队约定以及与团队的跟进 Day 3: Team agreements & follow-up with teams

团队以最后一轮自设计迭代开启第三天的活动。在完成团队自设计后，团队继续做了几件事情并达成了一些团队约定：

* 团队名字
* 团队之歌
* 权衡选项并决策的指导原则
* 团队潜在困难以及如何应对
* 工作约定

Teams started day 3 with the final iteration of self-design. After the team self-design, teams worked on several things to get to some team agreements:

* Team name
* Team song
* Guiding principles to weigh options and make decisions
* Potential struggles for the team and how to cope with that
* Work agreements

团队也能够在一组Scrum Master中选择一位Scrum Master（限制条件：相同地点）。在这之后，每个团队内部组织了“完成/完成外”评审，从而了解自己能交付DoD定义的哪些部分，以及改进方向。

The teams were also able to choose a Scrum Master from the group of Scrum Masters (constraint: co-located). After that, each team did a Done/Undone review in its team, to learn which parts of the DoD they were able to deliver and where they should improve.

然后，参会人员共同讨论产品的运维支持类工作。除了客户特性之外，还有一些其它类型的工作，问题或缺陷常有发生，而且经常是“突发”的和计划之外的。Y Soft设有一个支持部，专门负责一级、二级和三级的产品运维支持工作，直接服务客户。如果支持部遇到无法解决的客户问题，或者需要研发支持，他们就会给研发（即团队）创建四级运维单。这些新成立的团队决定每个迭代由一个团队负责处理四级运维单，与支持部（有时是客户）共同解决这些问题。这个团队就是LeSS指南*处理特殊事项*中的快速响应团队，实现了由全部团队共同承担运维支持工作的轮换职责，并让其他团队得以聚焦。由于原架构下的团队是组件制的，大家各自处理这类支持事件，对大多数新团队来讲，这意味这他们缺乏足够的知识去处理所有运维单，因此大家都需要进一步学习。

Then, participants discussed the support for the product. Besides customer features, there will be other types of work, often bugs or defects coming in, often ‘sudden’ and not plannable. A support department within Y Soft takes care of first, second and third level support of the product, directly with customers. If the support department can’t fix the problem for the customer or needs R&D for that, they create a ‘level 4’ support ticket that is handled by R&D (meaning: the teams). The newly formed teams decided that one team per Sprint takes care of these level 4 support tickets and works with the support department (and customers sometimes) to fix these problems. This team is the fast-response team from the LeSS guide *Handling Special Items*, that enables a rotating responsibility shared among the teams for support and gives the other teams focus. Because the teams in the old structure were component focused and handled this support separately, for many teams it meant that they didn’t have the knowledge to support all tickets, and as a consequence they needed to learn that.

More elaboration on the activities of the 4-day event can be found in [this Appendix](#appendix-b-preparation-to-the-4-day-events-that-kicked-off-the-less-adoption).

##### 第四天：迭代计划 Day 4: Sprint Planning

在活动的最后一天，团队在新的结构下按照LeSS指南*迭代计划一*组织了他们的第一次迭代计划第一部分。Jürgen解释了迭代计划的目的和指导原则。产品负责人以说明产品优先级开启了迭代计划。

On the last day of the event, teams did their first Sprint Planning One in the new setup, following the LeSS guide *Sprint Planning One*. Jürgen explained the purpose of the Sprint Planning and the guidelines of the Sprint Planning. The Product Owner opened the Sprint Planning by explaining the priorities from his perspective.

每个团队分享了他们在下一个迭代的可用时间安排（假期、会议等），以及他们需要完成的已经在进行中的工作。此外，他们补充了要解决的缺陷。然后，有一个集市让团队就自己挑选的PBIs跟大家分享他们下一个迭代的选择与设计。这些PBIs都被打印出来，以便团队可以方便抓取选择，并和其他团队讨论谁会选哪个PBI。

Each team shared which availability they had for the upcoming Sprint (holidays, meetings etc.) and the things they needed to finish that were already in progress. Additionally, they added bugs to solve. Then, there was a bazaar for teams to share their selection and design of their Sprint, for the PBI’s they picked themselves. These PBI’s were printed so teams could grab them to select and discuss with other teams who would pick which PBI.

下一步，每个团队独立地定制迭代目标。然后，所有团队的迭代目标被集合起来，大家对即将到来的迭代约定形成一个整体的迭代目标。重要的是，与Scrum不同，LeSS并不强制要求迭代目标。当迭代目标有用且存在自然明确的整体目标时，那就应用它。但是当没有一个自然明确的整体目标时（比如，因为团队间工作的异质性），最好就不要有一个共同的迭代目标。

In the next step, each team crafted a Sprint Goal individually. Then, all Sprint Goals were collected and there was an agreement on an Overall Sprint Goal for all teams combined for the upcoming Sprint. Important to mention is that LeSS - in contrast to Scrum - doesn’t require a Sprint Goal. When useful and when there is a natural clear overall goal, it’s good to apply. But when there isn’t a natural clear overall goal (e.g. because of the heterogeneity of work across teams), then it’s better to not have a common Sprint Goal.

在同一个房间内，每个团队选择（打印好的）他们想要做的PBIs放到位于他们自己团队空间里的迭代待办列表中（墙上的魔贴白纸）。在LeSS指南*多团队迭代计划二*中，强调所有团队应该在同一个房间内进行迭代计划二，以便能够通过“直接沟通”或“直接呼叫”的方式来与其他团队进行协作。

Each team selected the - printed - PBI’s they want to work on into their Sprint Backlog (magic whitepaper on the wall) in their team space in the room. In the LeSS guide *Multi-Team Sprint Planning Two*, it’s emphasized to have the Sprint Planning Two in the same room with all teams, to be able to coordinate with other teams using the *‘just talk’* or ‘just scream’ technique.

在团队成员查看其他团队选择时，会按照最小化团队间依赖的指令原则将某些事项从一个团队转移到其他团队。在LeSS中不存在依赖，因为每个特性团队都具备必要知识和能力去完成以客户为中心的端到端特性。如果不能，则会期望团队能够学习获取所需的知识技能。由于团队是全新的，所以可能存在有些特性没有团队具备端到端交付它的知识能力。在迭代计划的第二部分，团队会相互协调如何端到端地交付特性，如果需要他们会借助其他团队的知识和技能，最好是通过主动学习这些知识技能来达成。这样就消除了依赖，因为是团队一起同时来确保特性被完成。事后看来，要求团队尽量减少依赖的指令可能会给团队带来错误的认知，因为重点应该放在通过与其他团队合作来学习和获取知识技能。这些不应该被视为依赖，而只是一起工作来学习并完成特性。随着时间的推移，通过传递正确的信息应该能够消除存在依赖的认知。

Team members looked at the selection of other teams with the instruction to minimize dependencies between teams and move things from teams to other teams. In LeSS, there are no dependencies, because each feature team has the necessary knowledge and skills to complete an end-to-end customer-centric feature. If not, the team is expected to learn or acquire the needed knowledge and skill. The teams were new, and therefore some features didn’t have teams yet with all the knowledge and skills to deliver it end-to-end. In Sprint Planning Two, the teams coordinated between each other how to deliver the features end-to-end, with help from knowledge and skills from other teams if needed, preferably by learning them. This way, there is no dependency, because the teams together - at the same time - make sure the features get done. In hindsight, the instruction to minimize dependencies might have given the wrong perception to teams, because the focus should be on learning or acquiring the knowledge and skills, by working together with the other teams. And these are not dependencies, but simply working together to learn and get features done. Over time, that should have eliminated the perception of having dependencies, by giving the right message.

在最后，所有参会者通过一个舞蹈挑战来庆祝为期4天活动的圆满结束。而且从那个时刻起，新团队将正式按照新的结构开始一起工作。

At the end, all participants celebrated with a dancing challenge! And from that moment the new teams would start working together in the new structure.

#### 1.2.5 组织设计元素 Organizational Design elements

组织设计（OD）实验中包含的OD元素总结和简短说明：

A summary and short elaboration of the OD-elements that were involved in the OD experiment:

* *LeSS规则: 使用真正的团队作为基本组织构造块来构建组织。*

* *LeSS rule: Structure the organization using real teams as the basic organizational building block.*

产品是由团队创造的，而传统组织是围绕个人问责构建的。个人问责并不能促成为实现目标而承担共同责任的运作良好的团队。这是为什么围绕（真正的）团队构建组织是重要的组织设计元素之一，也因此有了LeSS指南*构建基于团队的组织*。围绕团队构建组织会带来重要的影响。团队是工作的主要承担者，而非个人；也就是说个人不会在组织中被随意挪动或资源化。这也意味着工作到团队，而不是个人。作为结果，组织结构将保持（更加）稳定，不需要进行重构，从而避免了所有相关的负面后果。这些团队围绕客户价值来组建，而不是围绕子产品或者组织职能。很多组织是按职能搭建的，在这种情况下影响会比较大。在LeSS导入前，Y Soft实验过跨职能团队，但是未能以这种方式改变其研发组织。从LeSS导入开始，团队就成为产品的构建块。然而架构师和用户体验专家却是例外，他们在LeSS导入过程中始终游离于团队之外。

Products are created by teams, while traditional organizations are built around individual accountability. Individual accountability doesn’t promote well-functioning teams that take a shared responsibility to achieve their goal. That’s why an important OD-element is to structure the organization around (real) teams and thus the LeSS guide: *Build Team-Based Organizations*. Building your organizations around teams has significant implications. Teams are the primary go to for work, rather than individuals, which also means that individuals are not shifted and ‘resourced’ through the organization. This also means that work goes to teams, instead of individuals. As a consequence, the organizational structure will stay (much more) stable and doesn’t need to be restructured, with all of its negative consequences. These teams form around customer value, not around sub-products or organizational functions. Many organizations are organized by functions, and in that case, the implications are big. Before the LeSS adoption, Y Soft experimented with cross-functional teams, but didn’t change their R&D organization yet this way. From the start of the LeSS adoption, teams became the building block for the product. The exception were the Architects and the UX specialists, who were still outside of the teams in the LeSS adoption.


* *LeSS规则：每个团队是 (1) 自管理的，（2） 跨职能的，（3） 同在一地的，（4）长期的。*

* *LeSS rule: Each team is (1) self-managing, (2) cross-functional, (3) co-located, and (4) long-lived.*


作为前一个组织设计元素的推论，LeSS定义了"团队"的含义。有些对团队的解释并没有体现出基于团队的组织应该带来的好处。因此，团队是自管理的、跨职能的、同在一地的和长期的。此外 - 也许不是必须的 - 每个成员应该100%都属于一个且唯一一个团队。团队需要具有（职能的）能力去产生一个可交付的的产品（并且持续提升跨职能程度）。如果你希望长期存在的团队关注他们作为一个团队如何协作，那么这些团队就需要有稳定性。研发团队重新自设计成为跨职能团队，在同一地方，这些团队长期在一起（除非自然原因，如员工离职）。随着时间推移，团队学会了更多的自管理。但是，自管理方面的改进主要发生第二个OD实验中，那里发生了更多的OD变革，更多介绍请参考[下述章节](#2-experiment-2-organizational-design-redesigning-the-feature-teams-and-removing-the-management-layer)。

As a corollary to the previous OD-element, LeSS defined what it means to be a team. Some interpretations of a team won’t give the benefits the team-based organization should bring. Therefore teams are self-managing, cross-functional, co-located and long-lived. Additionally - perhaps unnecessary - each team member is dedicated 100% of this time to one and only one team. The teams need to have the (functional) skills to produce a shippable product (and improve the cross-functionality over time). Long-lived teams need to have stability if you want them to care about how they work as a team. The teams within R&D redesigned themselves into cross-functional teams, at one location and these teams stayed together for a long time (exceptions are natural changes like people moving). Over time, the teams learned to self-manage more. However, this improved especially in the second OD experiment, when additional OD changes were made, more about that in [upcoming sections](#2-experiment-2-organizational-design-redesigning-the-feature-teams-and-removing-the-management-layer).

* *LeSS规则: 大部分团队是以客户为中心的特性团队。*

* *LeSS rule: The majority of the teams are customer-focused feature teams.*

根据LeSS指南*理解特性团队*来创建特性团队，意味着围绕客户价值来组建团队，专注于客户领域而非技术领域（技术专长是在以客户为中心过程中一种偶然的专业化）。特性团队是稳定的、长期的团队，具备端到端交付以客户为中心的特性所需的知识与技能。如果并非如此，那么团队被期望去学习获取所需的知识与技能。这*并不*意味着每个团队可以*交付每个特性*。例如，一个较大的特性被分解为多个以客户为中心的部分（并非组件或技术模块），然后通常由不同的特性团队去完成交付。每个团队有能力交付这样的特性（或者通过学习获取能力来交付）。基于LeSS导入原则*采用志愿者*，当前团队通过自设计被重新组织为特性团队。另一种方式是随时间推移不断增加团队的范围和跨职能程度，比如使用*特性团队导入地图*（LeSS指南）。通过这种方式，团队随时间推移慢慢成长为特性团队。开发产品的团队在LeSS导入之初，通过自设计转变为跨职能的和以客户为中心的团队。他们不断优化以具备尽可能多的技能。更多详情，请参考[检视章节](#134-inspection-od-element-less-rule-the-majority-of-the-teams-are-customer-focused-feature-teams)。

Creating Feature Teams according to the LeSS guide *Understanding Feature Teams*, means that the team organize around customer value and specialize in customer domain instead of technological domain (technological specialization is an accidental specialization as it follows the customer-focus). A Feature Team is a stable, long-lived team with the necessary knowledge and skills to complete an end-to-end customer-centric feature. If not, the team is expected to learn or acquire the needed knowledge and skill. This *doesn’t* mean that every team can *deliver every feature*. For example, a big feature is splitted into customer-centric parts (instead of component or technology parts) and delivered by - often - different Feature Teams. Each team can deliver that feature (or learns or acquires to do so). In the LeSS Adoption Principle *Use Volunteering*, teams can be formed by self-design to redesign the existing teams into Feature Teams. Another option is to grow the scope and cross-functionality over time, for example using the *Feature Team Adoption Map* (LeSS guide). This way, the teams over time grow to Feature Teams. The teams working for the product redesigned themselves at the start of the LeSS adoption to become cross-functional and customer-focused. They optimized to have as many skills in their team as possible. More about that in [the inspection section](#134-inspection-od-element-less-rule-the-majority-of-the-teams-are-customer-focused-feature-teams).


* *LeSS规则: 产品定义应该基于实际尽可能的宽泛和以用户/客户为中心。随着时间推移，产品定义也许会拓展，我们倾向于更宽泛的定义。*

* *LeSS rule: The definition of product should be as broad and end-user/customer centric as is practical. Over time, the definition of product might expand. Broader definitions are preferred.*

在LeSS导入前，“产品”其实是整个产品的架构组件，每个组件由一个团队来聚焦。在决定开始LeSS导入后，在为导入准备的组织改进Kata工作坊中，参会人员共同定义了产品。最初的产品定义是整个产品 - SAFEQ - 包括全部的架构组件，除了基础设施。此外，全部外围职责也被包含到产品定义内，例如技术支持、回归测试和产品发布。这几乎覆盖了全研发部门，而且因为SAFEQ在当时是公司的主要产品，所以也影响了研发与Y Soft内部绝大多数其他部门的协作。一个宽泛的产品定义，不能比这更加以用户/客户为中心了。

Before the start of the LeSS adoption the ‘products’ were architectural parts of the whole products, each with a team focusing on one part of the architecture. After deciding to start a LeSS adoption, and in preparation of the LeSS adoption, in the organizational improvement kata workshop the participants defined the product definition together. The initial product definition was the whole product - SAFEQ - and all architectural parts of it, except for the infrastructure. Additionally, all surrounding functions were included in the product definition, e.g. the support duty, regression testing and releasing the product. This included the largest part of the R&D department, and as SAFEQ was at the time the main product of the company, it affected the collaboration with most other departments of Y Soft. A broad product definition, which couldn’t be more end-user/customer centric.

* *LeSS实验: 尝试...通过消除“完成外”的工作来消除“完成外”的单元*

* *LeSS experiment: Try...Eliminating the ‘Undone’ unit by eliminating ‘Undone’ work*

拥有一个“完成外”单元（如Y Soft的测试和发布团队）会延迟增量的实施交付，延迟学习与反馈，并削弱了团队的责任感。因此，“完成外”单元应该被消除。Y Soft内部最关键的“完成外”单元是测试和发布团队。在团队自设计过程中，测试和发布团队的成员加入了特性团队。团队达成一致，轮流负责创建发布版本（每次发布轮流）和支持工作（每个迭代轮流）。这个团队就是LeSS指南*处理特殊事项*中的快速响应团队，实现了由全部团队共同承担运维支持工作的轮换职责，并让其他团队得以聚焦。


Having an ‘Undone’ unit (Y Soft had a test & release team) delays creating a done increment, delays learning and feedback and removes responsibility from teams. Therefore, the ‘Undone’ units should be removed. Most significant ‘Undone’ unit within Y Soft was the test & release team. In the team self-design, the people from the test & release team joined the feature teams. Teams made the agreement to have teams rotate for creating releases (per release) and support duty (per Sprint). This team is the fast-response team from the LeSS guide *Handling Special Items*, that enables a rotating responsibility shared among the teams for support and gives the other teams focus.

这不但消除了瓶颈，还在共享“流程”方面带来了很多改进，如运维支持、问题修复、回归测试和产品发布。为了完成这些“流程”任务，团队需要学习很多技能（而且需要互相教导与帮助），在一年后，大部分团队都可以胜任这些“流程”中的大部分任务。此外，团队也做了很多流程改进，因为他们现在要对整个产品负责。有时候这感觉很痛苦，需要付出很多努力，有时还会出现错误，所以影响并不小。但是，团队更好地理解了整个产品，并共同承担责任。


This removed bottlenecks and created big improvements on shared ‘processes’, like support, fixing bugs, regression testing and the releasing of the product. Teams learned a lot to accomplish this (and needed to teach and help each other), and after a year most teams could do most of these ‘processes’. Additionally, teams improved a lot in these processes, because they are responsible for them throughout the whole product now. It felt sometimes painful and was a lot of effort and mistakes were sometimes made, so the implications were not small. However, teams learned to know the whole product better and shared responsibility.

* *LeSS实验：避免...职能单元*

* *LeSS experiment: Avoid...Functional units*

许多组织都是围绕职能专业来构建的，如测试、开发、架构和产品营销。这些职能单元的存在会因其有限的职能视角导致局部优化。相反则以（跨职能）团队作为组织单元。在Y Soft案例中，LeSS导入前研发部是以职能单元构建的，一些（中层）领导负责测试、开发、架构等团队。在LeSS导入的重组中，这些领导转变为（跨职能）团队的负责人。唯一的例外就是安全和架构部门，架构师们决定（目前暂时）不加入团队。而安全专家确实加入了团队，但他们也同时非常积极向没有安全专家的团队传播安全知识，这有效限制了安全方面的局部优化。

Many organizations are structured around functional specializations like test, development, architecture and product marketing. These functional units lead to local optimization with limited perspective for the functional specialists. Instead, have the (cross-functional) teams as the organizational units. In Y Soft’s case, before the LeSS adoption, there were functional units within R&D with (middle) managers responsible for testing, development, architecture etc. In the restructuring at the time of the LeSS adoption, the managers became manager of a few (cross-functional) teams. The only exceptions were security and architecture, but the architects decided not to take part in the teams (yet). The security specialists did take place in teams, but were also very active to spread the security knowledge to teams without security specialists, which limited the local optimization for security.

* *LeSS实验：尝试...工作再设计*

* *LeSS experiment: Try...Work redesign*

在Scrum中，团队每个迭代都交付完整的以客户为中心的产品待办条目。这对工作的组织方式、以及工作的设计都有很大影响。在这一点上，重要的是要从客户的角度为团队设计更广泛的工作职责。作为采用*组件团队*的自然结果，Y Soft内部的工作设计聚焦于组件、技术和功能。在开始导入LeSS时，工作被重新设计以覆盖以客户为中心的产品待办条目，将（不同*组件*和*职能*）的任务结合在*特性团队*中。

In Scrum, teams finish complete customer-centric Product Backlog Items each iteration. This has a big impact on the organization of work, but also at the design of the work. Important in this is to design the work with broader responsibilities for teams from a customer perspective. As a logical consequence of having *component teams*, the work design within Y Soft was focused on components, technology and functions. When starting the LeSS adoption, the work was redesigned to cover customer-centric Product Backlog Items, combining tasks (of different *components* and *functions*) in the *feature teams*.

从LeSS原则“以小为大”的角度检视[组织设计原则](https://less.works/blog/2020/03/02/more-with-less-seven-tools-for-simplifying-organizations.html) 

Inspecting at the [organization design principles](https://less.works/blog/2020/03/02/more-with-less-seven-tools-for-simplifying-organizations.html) from the LeSS principle More with LeSS:

我们使用下述组织设计原则来简化成为LeSS组织：

We use the following organizational design principles to descale into LeSS organizations:

1. 从专家角色到团队：团队成为组织构建块。随着时间的推移，特定领域的专家（主要是技术领域）在团队内部和外部分享他们的知识，因此团队获得了这些知识，而不再依赖个别专家。

2. 从资源思维到人才思维：组织构建的基础逐渐转变为团队，个人绩效评估转变为团队反馈。组织仍旧期望以完整团队的形式增加“产能”，这表明在一定程度上资源思维仍旧存在；但随着时间的推移，渐渐转变为更加注重人才的思维。一个人才思维的例子是，CEO发现研发部门的的薪酬低于市场平均水平，于是他大幅提升研发部门所有员工的薪资到高于平均水平。

3. 从围绕技术的组织到围绕客户价值的组织：团队转变为特性团队，聚焦以客户为中心的产品待办条目。技术显然也是重要的，但是专业知识在团队内部和团队间分享。

4. 从独立团队到持续的跨团队协作：LeSS实施促进了跨团队协作和现状的透明度。在LeSS启动后有了越来越多的协作，但是真正的和更为持续的协作需要时间去学习。

5. 从“协调以集成”到“通过集成实现协调”：这的确是个挑战，具体可参考[1.3.6章节](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work)。因为团队对全部产品相关的工作负责，他们开始不断改进前提条件和行为以持续地集成。

6. 从项目到产品：对研发来讲，不再有项目的概念，全部工作都来自于一份产品待办列表。尽管在研发外部仍旧有一些项目，但这些项目对研发影响有限。有时产品待办列表中的待办条目源自某些外部项目，如营销领域的项目。

7. 从多个小产品到少数宽泛的大产品：与*组件团队*聚焦具体组件开发、职能团队关注具体职能工作不同，重新定义的产品定义让多个团队一起工作在同一个产品上。这是从多个小产品转变到一个大产品的良好开始。在这个产品之外，公司还有许多其他小产品，但是这个产品在当时是Y Soft的核心产品。

1. From Specialist Roles to Teams: teams became the organizational building block. Over time, specialists in certain (mostly technological) domains shared their knowledge within and outside their team, so teams would gain that knowledge instead of relying on individual specialists.
2. From Resource-Thinking to People-Thinking: the building block of the organization became teams and individual performance appraisals changed to team feedback. There was still a desire to add ‘capacity’ in the form of full teams, which suggests still some Resource-Thinking and over time this is something that slowly improved to more People-Thinking. One example of People-thinking is that the CEO found out that the compensations were below average compared to the market, and he increased the compensations massively for everyone in R&D to get above average.
3. From Organizing around Technology to Organizing around Customer Value: teams became feature teams working on customer-centric Product Backlog Items. Technology was obviously still important, but specialism was shared within and amongst teams.
4. From Independent Teams to Continuous Cross-team Cooperation: the LeSS adoption improved the cross-team cooperation and transparency on what’s going on. After the start of the LeSS adoption, there was more cooperation, but real and more continuous cooperation took a while to learn.
5. From Coordinate to Integrate to Coordination through Integration: this was still a challenge, see also [this section](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work). Because teams became responsible for all product-related work, they started improving the preconditions and behavior to integrate continuously.
6. From Projects to Products: for R&D there were no more projects and all work came from a single Product Backlog. Though there were projects outside R&D, they had limited impact on the teams, sometimes there were PBI’s on the Product Backlog that originated from a project. These projects were used for e.g. marketing.
7. From Many Small Products to a Few Broad Products: instead of having *component teams* working on specific components and functional teams working on functions, the definition of the single product was redefined to one with many teams working on the same product. A good first step moving from many small products to one broad product. Outside this product, there were some other (still small) products in the company, but the product was the main product for Y Soft at the time.

### 1.3 检视 Inspect

在这一部分，我们将对组织设计（OD）实验进行检视，重点关注OD变化以及LeSS导入。首先，我们将进行一般性检视，然后针对随LeSS导入而改变的OD元素进行具体检视。

In this section, there is an inspection on the Organizational Design (OD) experiment by looking at the OD changes and the LeSS adoption. First, a generic inspection, and later an inspection on the OD-elements that were changed with the start of the LeSS adoption.

#### 1.3.1 第一个OD实验的一般性检视 Generic inspection of the first OD experiment

Y Soft通过LeSS导入获得很多收益，即使在最初动荡“痛苦”的3个月（如下）。首先，未来全部的工作被整合为一份产品待办列表，并且由一位产品负责人确定优先级。尽管刚开始还不完美，但是团队确实更清楚了解了工作优先级，并且能相对容易地自行决策。其次，团队能够更好地看到和理解完整的产品，并且能交付比以前更端到端的以客户为中心特性。第三，由于团队跨职能和跨组件能力提升，以及共同承担责任，等待队列和等待时间减少了。第四，消除了瓶颈，并改进了共享的“流程”，如执行回归测试、修复缺陷、运维支持和产品发布。关于最后一点的更多介绍，请参考[1.3.6](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work)。

Y Soft experienced big benefits from the LeSS adoption, even though the first 3 months were bumpy and considered ‘painful’ (see below). First, all the future work was collected in one Product Backlog and was prioritized by a single Product Owner. Though this wasn’t perfect yet, teams had more clarity about priorities and could make decisions easier themselves. Second, teams were better able to see and understand the whole product, and additionally able to deliver customer centric features more end-to-end than before. Third, there were less queues and waiting time because of the improved cross-functionality and cross-component nature of teams and the shared responsibility of teams. This is the fourth main benefit: removed bottlenecks and improvements on shared ‘processes’, like executing regression tests, solving bugs, having support duty and releasing the product. More reflection on the last point is in [this section](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work).

在启动LeSS导入后，新成立的特性团队开始了第一个迭代的工作。团队开始端到端地交付完整特性。这些特性更加以客户为中心（尽管还不完美）。对于组织的其它部分，研发不再是一个黑盒子，因为产品待办列表和团队当前进行的工作变得更加透明。Y Soft内部的干系人能更好地了解在被开发的内容，并能够更好地在他们的工作中使用这些信息，例如，在与客户沟通中（为比如产品营销）。

After the start of the LeSS adoption, the newly formed feature teams started working in the first Sprint. Teams were delivering whole features end-to-end. These features were more customer-centric (though not perfect yet). For the rest of the organization, R&D was less of a black box, because of the higher transparency of the Product Backlog and what the teams were working on. Stakeholders within Y Soft had better understanding of what was developed and could better use this in their work, e.g. in communication with customers (for e.g. product marketing).

Y Soft已经高度聚焦客户：客户需求被认真对待并优先处理，与供应商（销售打印机的合作伙伴，他们在打印机里嵌入了Y Soft打印管理解决方案）紧密协作。Y Soft的员工对产品充满热情，渴望推动产品发展并向客户交付价值。在LeSS导入开始后，团队与客户和供应商之间的直接联系更加紧密，因为他们现在开发以客户为中心的特性，而不是仅仅关注组件需求。

Y Soft already had a high customer focus: customer requests are taken seriously, get priority and the collaboration with ‘vendors’ (the partners that sell the printers with the print management solution of Y Soft embedded) is intensive. People in Y Soft are passionate about the product and eager to move things forward and deliver value to customers. After the start of the LeSS adoption, teams got more in direct touch with customers and vendors, because they were working on customer-centric features instead of component requirements.

然而，已有痛点的透明化也有不利的一面，这也是团队导入Scrum过程中非常可预见的情况：一些人把这些痛点归咎于新的工作方式和LeSS。大家需要与他人分享知识（有些人并不喜欢这样）；需要做回归测试，但之前这不是必须的；需要共同进行产品待办列表的梳理细化，而之前只是部分人创建需求而已，等等。一些人没有努力改进系统，而是互相指责。一些关注“效率”和*产出*（而非*成果*）的团队经理强化了这种状况；他们推动团队快速完成工作，而不是聚焦质量和产品改进。这种推动自然是由历史上的“效率和产出”管理指标和奖金所驱动的，尽管这些指标和奖金已经被取消，但人们还没有因此改变他们的行为。然而，高层管理仍然关注所谓的“速度”，即团队在一个迭代中所完成的工作量。这种关注最初延续了这种行为，尽管这并没有与之相关的奖金。后来，当事情逐渐稳定下来，新的产品负责人 (参考 [章节3.2.4](#324-change-of-product-owners))上任后，团队感受到的压力才慢慢减少。

However, the transparency of the old pains also had a downside, a very predictable one familiar to groups adopting Scrum: some people blamed the new way of working and LeSS for these pains. People needed to share their knowledge with other people for whole product knowledge (which some people didn’t like), people had to do regression testing while they didn’t have to do that before, doing Product Backlog Refinement together while before some people created requirements etc. Instead of working to improve the system, the blaming prevailed. This was reinforced by some of the managers of the teams that were focusing on “efficiency” and *output* (not *outcome*), and they pushed teams into doing the things fast, and not always focusing on quality and improving the product. And that pushing of course was driven by historic “efficiency and output” management measurement and bonuses, which were removed, but people didn’t change their behavior based on that yet. However, there was still focus of top management on so-called “velocity”, the amount of work that teams did in a Sprint. That continued this behavior initially, even though there were no bonuses attached to it. Later, when things settled down and the new Product Owner (see [this section](#324-change-of-product-owners)) came, slowly the feeling of teams to get pressured decreased.

总体来说，最初的几个迭代被描述为是“痛苦的”，但它们带来了大量的透明度，为持续改进工作奠定了基础。在外部支持下，产品总监和Scrum Master们持续努力进一步优化产品开发过程，这是一段曲折而挑战的旅途。

All in all, the first Sprints were described as ‘painful’, but they brought a lot of transparency to continue working on improvement. With some external support, the Head of Product and the Scrum Masters kept working on improving product development further, which was a bumpy ride.

几个月后，产品开发方面似乎有了很多改进。虽然价值没有被度量，但团队的产出和可预测性方面有了明显进步。团队将这一点视为自身的重要改进，尽管产出（不同于*成果*）如果不带来价值且不直接贡献于适应性的话并不那么重要。其他被视为改进的迹象还有：

* 客户和供应商直接参与了一些主要特性的开发。
* 内部干系人对更好的特性开发结果表示感激。
* 内部干系人与团队之间的合作更加紧密。
* 更互动的PBR，团队之间更多的分享和学习。
* 更清晰透明的产品待办列表，更明确（且艰难）的特性优先级决策。
* 团队对现有的工作方式显然更加满意。

After a few months, there seemed to be a lot of improvements in the product development. Though value was still not measured, the output and predictability of teams had grown massively. Teams felt this as important improvements for themselves, even though output (vs *outcome*) is not important if it doesn’t bring value and doesn’t contribute directly to adaptiveness. Some other signs that felt like improvements:

* Customers and vendors directly involved in some of the main features.
* Internal stakeholders showed gratitude for better results on developing features.
* Internal stakeholders worked more closely with teams.
* More interactive PBR with more sharing and learning between teams.
* More transparency on the Product Backlog and more explicit - and hard - decisions taken on the priority of features.
* Teams were visibly happier about the way of working.

尽管大多数团队都感到更加满意，但在LeSS导入的第一年，Y Soft流失了大约20%的员工。这些人可能感觉是被迫加入到LeSS变革中，而不是自愿的。由于该产品是公司的一个主要产品，员工内部调动到其他部门的选择有限。如果公司能更好地传达自愿的真实选项，并管理好大家的期望，也许能阻止部分员工的离职。说明：后来CEO发现员工薪资低于市场平均水平，于是他大幅提高了研发部门每个人的薪资，使其高于平均水平。因为一些人员提到薪酬是他们离职的原因。

Though most teams were happier, Y Soft lost around 20% of the people in the first year of the LeSS adoption. People might have felt forced into the change to LeSS, instead of being a volunteer. As the product is the one big product of the company, there were limited options to move to other parts of the organization. Communicating well about the real option of volunteering and setting expectations with people well, could have prevented part of the people leaving. Note: later the CEO found out that the compensations were below average compared to the market, and he increased the compensations massively for everyone in R&D to get above average. For some people leaving, compensation was the reason they mentioned.

##### 重新对齐工作坊 Re-Alignment Workshop

几个月后，Y Soft意识到他们在LeSS导入方面需要帮助。他们请Jürgen De Smet组织了一系列的工作坊，以检视LeSS导入的情况、进一步改进，并为下一步转向LeSS巨型作准备。第一场工作坊是重新对齐工作坊，旨在更好地了解组织系统，并能够识别哪些系统变量需要改进。CEO、产品总监、研发管理层和Scrum Master代表参加了这个工作坊。

After a few months, Y Soft realized that they needed help with their LeSS adoption. They asked Jürgen De Smet to do a series of workshops to inspect the LeSS adoption, improve further and help prepare for a future move to LeSS Huge. The first of these workshops was a re-alignment workshop to get a better understanding of the organizational system and be able to determine which system variables to improve. The CEO, Head of Product, R&D management and Scrum Master representatives participated in this workshop.

参会者们创建了一个*系统模型*（因果回路图），并识别了一些趋势指标来定期评估所采取的措施是否带来了整体系统改进。这次工作坊提出的主要评估指标包括：

* 合并PR的时间
* 特性与其它类型PBI的比例
* 修复构建失败的时间
* 修复缺陷的时间
* 每个迭代的预估商业价值
* 工作满意度
* 迭代交付的可预测性
* 版本交付的可预测性

The participants created a *system model* (causal loop diagram) and identified trend metrics to regularly evaluate whether actions done would lead to overall system improvements. Some of the main metrics to evaluate that came out of this workshop were:

* Time to merge pull request
* Ratio features vs other types of PBI’s
* Time to fix broken builds
* Time to fix bugs
* Estimated business value per Sprint
* Work satisfaction
* Predictability of Sprint delivery
* Predictability of Release delivery

得出的因果回路图如下： The resulting causal loop diagram:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/systems-model-re-alignment.png" alt="System Model of re-alignment">
</figure>

以下是局部放大图：Zoomed in on a part of the diagram:

<figure>*
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/systems-model-re-alignment-zoomed.png" alt="System Model of re-alignment Zoomed">
</figure>

这次工作坊和识别出的系统评估指标让团队更好地理解组织系统。他们在一段时间内收集了许多洞见，但并未专注于形成共识以真正改进。参会者选择关注的指标主要集中在“迭代交付的可预测性”、“特性与其它类型PBI的比例”以及“合并PR的时间”。而团队尤其经常使用前两个指标来检视进度，并确定改进方向。请注意，可预测性指标并*不*是Scrum和LeSS所追求的，因为优化目标是*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*，这在某些情况下与可预测性是背道而驰的。对可预测性的需求也源于过去，那时因为各种原因客户需求和协议未能满足。产品营销和CEO希望提高可预测性，以便能够更好地与客户达成协议。只要交付时间满足他们共同设定的时间（或更早），就没有交期的压力。自从LeSS导入以来，由团队设定预期的交付日期，而不是像以前那样由项目经理设定截止日期。工作坊的目的是让Y Soft的人员找出自己的指标，而很少精力放在对指标的具体目标的讨论。

The result of the workshop and the system metrics led to better understanding. They collected many of the insights for a while, but didn’t focus on shared understanding to really improve them. The metrics the participants chose to focus on were mostly ‘predictability of Sprint delivery’, ‘ratio features vs other types of PBI’s’ and ‘time to merge pull requests’. Teams used especially the first two often to check progress and identify further improvements. Note that the predictability metrics are *not* what is desired in Scrum and LeSS, because the optimization goal is to be *adaptive to discover highest customer value or delight*, which in some cases is the opposite of predictability. The need for predictability also originated from the past, where customer requests and agreements were not met for all sorts of reasons. Product marketing and the CEO wanted more predictability to be better able to make agreements with customers. There was no pressure from them to have it as soon as possible, as long as the delivery would be at the time (or earlier) they set together. Since the LeSS adoption, teams set the expected dates of delivery, in contrast to the previous project manager set deadlines. The intention of the workshop was to let the people from Y Soft find out their own metrics, and little emphasis was on the discussion of the results of metrics.

对产品开发系统动态建模的结果被用来作为后续关于成熟度模型及创造新的组织设计的工作坊的基础。后续工作坊是一个改进Kata工作坊，旨在确定如何逐步达成下一个目标。

The results from the product development system dynamics modeling were used as the foundation for the follow-up workshop on maturity models and creating a new organizational design. The follow-up workshop was an Improvement Kata workshop to identify steps to the next target condition.

工程师、Scrum Master和管理层参加了为期两天的成熟度模型工作坊。这个由不同角色组成的参会者群体定义了Y Soft背景下的“成熟度”含义，并确定了哪些角色和元素与成熟度模型相关。这导致了不同类别的多个成熟度模型：

* 被授权的自驱型团队
* 产品待办列表
* Scrum Masters
* 经理
* 技术卓越

Engineers, Scrum Masters and management participated in the two-day maturity model workshop. The mixed group of participants defined a definition of ‘maturity’ in Y Soft context, and identified which roles and elements are relevant for maturity models. This led to several maturity models for the categories:

* Empowered self-driven teams
* Product Backlog
* Scrum Masters
* Managers
* Technical excellence

参会者分别为每个类别定义了不同方面。例如，在“被授权的自驱型团队”这一类别中，参会者定义了如“工程技能水平”和“处理客户反馈”等方面。对于每个方面，他们都描述了五个成熟度级别的定义。例如，“工程技能水平”的第三级被描述为：“自行设计交付功能：我们能够自行设计和交付功能。如果团队中包含新手，他们会得到适当的支持（但不会被持续的监督或检查），并且会为他们制定发展计划。”

The participants defined areas for each category. For example, for the category ‘empowered self-driven teams’, the participants defined areas like ‘engineering skill level’ and ‘process customer feedback’. For each area, they described the definition of the five maturity levels. For example the description of level 3 of ‘engineering skill level’ was described as: ‘delivering features by our design: We are able to design and deliver the feature on our own. Where the team includes novices, they are appropriately supported (but not supervised or checked constantly) and their development planned.’

CEO、产品总监、研发中层管理者和一名Scrum Master讨论了生成的成熟度模型。一位外部顾问对现状（每个类别）进行了分析。在准备过程中，Scrum Master使用了之前工作坊的结果以及这项分析，选择了几个主题与CEO、产品总监和管理层进行讨论：

* 组织结构（包括LeSS巨型）
* 产品和产品领域定义及设置（包括待办列表）
* 该结构内的角色与职责
* 社区
* 成为技术领导者的使能因素
* 结构内的信息流和可用性
* 关键绩效指标（KPI）结构

The CEO, Head of Product, middle management of R&D and one Scrum Master discussed the resulting maturity models. An external consultant did an analysis of the current state (for each category). In the preparation, the Scrum Masters used the outcomes of previous workshops and this analysis to select several topics to discuss with the CEO, Head of Product and management:

* Organizational structure (including LeSS Huge)
* Product and product area definition and setup (incl backlogs)
* Roles & responsibilities within this structure
* Communities
* Enablers to become technology leader
* Information flow and availability within the structure
* KPI structures

该小组经过讨论后改进了部分主题。其中之一是解散架构团队，而让架构师加入各个团队。这次检视有效推动了当前组织设计和LeSS导入的改进。

The group improved some of these topics after the discussion. One of the improvements was the dissolution of the architectural team, and instead architects joining the teams. This inspection led to improvements in the current OD and LeSS adoption.

##### CEO现场巡检（Gemba walk）及博客记录 The CEO goes to Gemba and Blogs

布拉格的一支团队邀请CEO与他们一起工作了整整两天。在这两天里，他参加了他们的所有会议，并参与了集体编程（他在初创公司时就亲自参与产品研发，包括编码）以进行实际的产品开发。

One of the teams in Prague invited the CEO to participate for two full days to work with them. In those two days, he joined all their meetings and participated in mob programming sessions (including coding, he started developing the product himself when he founded the company) to do actual product development.

他在给公司全员的博客中关于这两天的几个亮点：

Some highlights from his blog to the whole company about these two days:

“过了一段时间，我觉得有些信息值得与大家分享。”[...]

‘After some time, I feel I have information worth sharing with everyone.’ [...]

“我很高兴接受来自布拉格研发办公室<*已移除的团队名*>团队的邀请，与他们共度了两天。我原想重新当两天工程师不仅会很有趣，还可以帮助我解释为什么我们的效率不能进一步提升。但实际上，这次体验比我预期的还要棒，所以我决定与全世界分享我的经历和发现。”

‘I welcomed the initiative of the \<*removed team name*\> team from Prague’s R&D office to join them for a couple of days. I thought becoming an engineer (again) for two days would not only be fun, but it can also help me to explain some reasons, why we aren't more efficient. It was actually even a greater experience than I expected, so I decided to share my experience and findings with the entire world.’ [...]

<u>第一天 Day 1</u>

“第一天，我们正在排查某个组件及其功能的缺陷。在升级到该工具的新版本后，看上去似乎需要在备份前进行一些额外的配置。我们采用了‘集体编程’（Mob Programming）。团队大约有6个人，只用一台电脑，并且每15分钟我们就会更换坐在电脑前的人。一开始，我认为这非常低效，我相当肯定这个工作由两个人做会快得多。但两个小时后，我意识到，由于采用了这种方式，整个团队 - 之前并不熟悉我们正在排查的SAFEQ部分 - 都获得了关于它的知识和经验。就连我，之前从未见过名为（工具名）的安装工具，也能很快编写代码。我从不相信自己能这么快地做出贡献，但幸亏‘集体编程’，我学得非常快。” [...]

‘The first day we were troubleshooting a defect in \<*name of component and what it does*\>. After upgrade to a new version of the tool, it seemed that some additional configuration needs to happen before the backup can be launched. We used a technique called Mob Programming. We had about 6 people in the team, one computer and each 15 minutes, we changed who is sitting behind the keyboard. At the beginning, I thought it was very inefficient and I was pretty sure, that just two people working on it would be much faster. After two hours I realized, that thanks to the technique, the whole team – who was not familiar with the part of SAFEQ we’ve been troubleshooting – gained the knowledge and experience about it. Even I, who never seen the installation tool called \<*name*\> before, was able to write code pretty fast. I would never believe that I can actually contribute this fast, but thanks to the mobbing I learnt so quick.’ [...]

“真正让我高兴的是，当我向团队提出挑战，告诉他们仅仅修复一个缺陷并不能改善客户体验时，团队真的严肃地对待了这个问题，除了解决问题本身，还做出了额外的改进：一旦安装了\<*工具\>*，工具可以实现自动配置数据库。这才是我们正确的工作方式：每当修复问题时，我们应该总是问自己，如何能让客户体验更好？而且这还不是全部。团队还将\<*工具*\>的配置文件纳入规范的代码管理，这将让未来改动起来很容易。所以，现在的代码比之前要整洁了一些。再次强调，这是一个小的、快速的改进。但是，如果我们每次修复缺陷时都做出这样小而不显著的改进，SAFEQ 将会变得越来越出众。”

‘What really made my day was when I challenged the team, that just fixing a defect will not improve customer experience. The team actually took it seriously and added an incremental improvement: once \<*tool\>* is installed, now it will be automatically configured for the database. This is the right way, how we should work: when we are fixing something, we should always ask, how can we improve customers’ life? But that’s not all. The team also took the \<*tool*\> configuration files and put them under standard source code control, which will make it very easy for future changes. So the code is now a little bit cleaner. Again, small quick improvement. But if we do small, insignificant, improvement with every defect we fix, SAFEQ will become significantly better.’

“总结下我的主要收获：

* 集体编程（Mob Programming）应该更频繁地用作一种学习方法，或者用于快速培训新员工。
* 大量不同的工具会大幅降低效率。我们需要努力简化并更好地记录如何使用这些工具（尤其是那些较少使用的工具）。
* 通过修复小错误来做出小的改进，从而不断改善SAFEQ用户和管理员的产品体验，这是可行的。”

‘To sum up my key takeaways:

* Mob Programming should be used more often as a learning technique or to fast-track newcomers.
* Lot of different tools lead to massive inefficiencies. We need efforts to simplify and better document, how are we using them (especially the tools that are use rather sporadically)
* It is possible to bring small improvements with small bug fixes and improve the life of SAFEQ users and admin.’

<u>第二天 Day 2</u>

“我们组织了一次梳理会议。这次会议的目的是深入探讨某个\<*话题*\>，并梳理它如何创造价值、需要完成哪些工作，以及工作量评估。这些信息随后将被产品营销团队用于路线图规划。主要发现是团队的业务知识不足。大家并不清楚为什么\<*话题*\>很重要。”

‘We started with a refinement session. The purpose of it is to dive deeper into a certain topic and refine how it delivers value, what needs to happen and estimate efforts. These inputs are later used by product marketing for roadmap planning. The main takeaway was that there is not enough business knowledge. The teams did not have a clear idea, why \<*topic*\> is important.’ [...]

“当梳理会议中至少有一位参会人了解(\<*示例主题*\>)时，会议会非常高效，并且也帮助很多人熟悉具体问题。估算过程富有建设性而又高效。这是一次很好的体验。”

‘When the refinement session had at least one knowledgeable person (\<*example topic*\>), the meeting was very productive and it also helped many people to get acquainted with the specific problem. The estimation process was constructive and efficient. Good experience.’

“之后我进行了\<*部分产品*\>的回归测试。虽然这个过程有详细的文档记录，但相关问题依旧花费了我大约一个小时的时间。说实话，这份工作相当无聊。我把工程师定义为是那种宁愿花3个小时去做自动化，而不愿意花1小时去手工做这类事情的人……但我得赶火车回布尔诺，所以我只好手动完成了。” [...]

‘After that I took regression testing of \<*part of product*\>. The process was well documented, but troubles with <part of product> cost me about an hour. To be honest, this work was rather boring. I define an engineer as someone, who would rather spend 3 hours by automation of something, that would manually take them about one hour… But I had to catch a train back to Brno so I did it manually.’ [...]

“我在火车上小憩了一会儿，梦想着有一天，我们的工程师将不再需要执行没有带来增值的简单管理工作步骤，因为即使是\<*组件名称*\> 的回归测试也将实现了自动化。毕竟，整个IT行业都是关于自动化的，不是吗？”

‘I took a short nap in the train dreaming about the day, when our engineers won’t need to do simple admin steps with no value add because even \<*component name*\> regression will be automated. Afterall, the whole IT industry is about automation, isn’t it?’

“第二天的主要收获是：

* 梳理工作有了显著改善，但前提是要有相关知识背景的人参与
* 我们对Epics如何交付价值以及它们的重要性缺乏足够的了解
* 我们在自动化方面虽然取得了很大进步，但仍然在花费大量时间进行手动测试（但与一年前相比，现在的情况已经得到了显著改善）。”

‘Key takeaways from day 2 are:

* Refinements significantly improved, but only if knowledgeable people are present
* We don’t have enough understanding how Epics deliver value and how important they are
* We improved a lot with automation, but we are still spending significant time on manual testing (but it is now improved in order of magnitudes compared to where we’ve been a year ago).’

#### 1.3.2 检视组织设计元素：LeSS规则：使用真正的团队作为基本组织构建块。Inspection OD-element: LeSS Rule: Structure the organization using real teams as the basic organizational building block.

自从启动LeSS导入的四天活动，形成了一份单一的产品待办列表，团队直接从中挑选工作。为了让团队能够按照客户价值来选择这些工作，并了解需要学习什么（技能），我们在产品战略和愿景上的薄弱变得很明显。例如，在产品待办列表梳理中，产品负责人无法很好地解释需要什么，甚至有时在梳理中优先级还会发生变化。Y Soft的员工习惯于在*项目*里工作，并将工作分解为不同职能和组件任务分配给不同的团队。从产品视角看，新工作模式对产品营销、产品负责人以及其他组织部门来说都是一个巨大的变化。以团队作为构建块需要这样的改变，但ScrumMasters和VP低估了以团队作为构建块与一个薄弱的产品愿景结合所带来的影响。

From the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption, there was a single Product Backlog and teams directly selecting work from the Product Backlog. To enable the teams to select this work following customer value and knowing what (skills) to learn, it became very transparent that the product strategy and vision was too weak. For example, during Product Backlog Refinement the Product Owner couldn’t explain well what was needed and even during refinement priority changed sometimes. People in Y Soft were used to working in *projects* and split the work into functional and component tasks for different groups. Working from a product perspective was a massive change for product marketing, the Product Owner and the rest of the organization. Having teams as building block required this, and the Scrum Masters and VP had underestimated the effect of having teams as building block and a weak product vision.

许多研发部门之外的人仍然使用非正式的沟通渠道要求研发部门承接和交付相关工作，例如存在其他部门的人仍然直接联系工程师。而这得到了部分研发经理的支持，他们接受这种做法，甚至直接将这类工作带给了团队！ScrumMasters需要确保其他部门的人理解他们必须直接与产品负责人（PO）沟通协作，以便对工作优先级进行合理排序（以及为什么有些工作根据优先级没有被选择），并且干系人必须亲自帮助团队正确理解工作的背景和价值。组织设计变革需要一段时间才能逐步运作正常。

Many people outside R&D still used unofficial communication channels to get work done from R&D, e.g. people from other departments that still contacted engineers directly. This was reinforced by some of the R&D managers that accepted this and even brought this work to the teams! Scrum Masters needed to make sure others understood they had to work with the PO directly to get work prioritized (and why work was not picked up based on priority), and that stakeholders had to help teams directly to make sure teams understood the context and value. The OD change took a while to work properly.

#### 1.3.3 检视组织设计元素：LeSS规则：每个团队是 (1) 自管理的，（2） 跨职能的，（3） 同在一地的，（4）长期的。Inspection OD-element: LeSS Rule: Each team is (1) self-managing, (2) cross-functional, (3) co-located, and (4) long-lived.

在导入LeSS之初，团队进行了自设计，他们在同地工作、保持团结、拥有工作所需的大部分（跨）职能技能，或通过学习掌握了这些技能。然而，更加困难的是实现自管理。工作是以客户为中心来组织的，团队拥有更多端到端的技能来完成工作。然而，他们仍然坚持被动应对的方式去执行工作和改进，并确保完成。由于他们有了更多的必要技能，所以工作自然变得更加容易，然而却未看到更多的改进。

The teams had self-designed themselves at the start of the LeSS adoption, they were co-located, stayed together and had most of the (cross) functional skills they needed or acquired the skills. The self-management was harder to achieve. Work was defined customer-centric and teams had more end-to-end skills to get work done. However, they still hold on to reactive behavior for work to be done, improve and make sure things get to done. Because they had more of the necessary skills, it automatically became easier, but there was not more improvement.

其中一个原因是，一些基本的Scrum原则没有得到很好的践行，这是因为在Scrum和LeSS导入过程中，Scrum Master缺乏经验。这导致了较低的经验主义，以及团队内部和团队之间学习的局限性。例如，在迭代计划中待办事项的透明度很低，团队之间的互动也很少，很难为下个迭代选出最优价值的工作。轮换的Scrum Master“主导”迭代计划，而大多数团队的参会代表只想让它快点结束。这样做带来的结果是，对于要交付的价值和所做的选择透明度有限，从而导致几乎没有互动，也几乎没有对下一步应该做什么的讨论。另一个例子是迭代评审，基本上就是各团队展示已交付的特性，没有形成反馈闭环，也没有从整个产品视角清晰展示增量。参会的内部干系人数量有限，未来的工作没有透明度 - 因此也没有形成检视和调整 - 以获取下一步工作的反馈。除此之外，普遍的意识是“改进是Scrum Master的事”（一位团队成员就是这么说的），所以团队没有承担改进他们工作和协作方式的责任。Scrum Master在6个多月的时间里都没有组织过一次整体回顾会议！一开始，产品负责人和支持产品营销的人员承担了团队该承担的责任，既扮演了领域专家的角色，又扮演了客户的角色，这阻碍了团队搞清楚客户问题，并强化了团队原先的行为模式：请告诉我们应该做什么。这些因素都不利于创造条件让团队学习自管理。

One of the reasons was that some basic Scrum principles were not implemented well, a consequence from having inexperienced Scrum Masters in Scrum and LeSS adoptions. This resulted in low empiricism and limited learning within and between teams. For example, in Sprint Planning there was low transparency on the work to be done, and little interaction between teams to come up with the best selection of value for the Sprint. A rotating Scrum Master ‘led’ the Sprint Planning and most team representatives just wanted the Sprint Planning to be over. Consequence was that there was limited transparency on the value to deliver and the choices made, which led to little interaction and almost no discussion on what best to do next. Another example was the Sprint Review, which were basically demo’s where teams shared some of the delivered features, without feedback and without transparency about the whole product Increment. Limited number of internal stakeholders joined, and there was no transparency - and thus no inspection and adaptation - on future work in order to get feedback on next steps. On top of that, the overall feeling was that ‘improvements are for Scrum Masters’ (one team member said that literally), so teams didn’t take responsibility to improve the way they worked and collaborated. The Scrum Masters didn’t organize an Overall Retrospective in over 6 months! At the start, the Product Owner and supporting Product Marketing people took responsibility from teams, by acting as both the domain experts and customers, which prevented teams from figuring out the customers’ problems and reinforced the previous behavior by teams: please tell us what to do. These factors are not helping to set the stage for teams to learn to self-manage.

Scrum Master非常勤奋地帮助和推进各项工作。然而，这也导致了补位行为，比如填补出现的各种工作漏洞，帮助“推动”事情向前发展以实现特性交付和问题修复。但是，团队没有因此学会自管理，没有为这些“漏洞”承担责任，而是继续依赖他人，从之前依赖项目经理到现在是依赖Scrum Master。通过一段时间的外部帮助，Scrum Master重新聚焦并改进了Scrum和LeSS的基础原则，以提高经验主义。其中一个例子就是改进产品待办列表梳理（PBR），帮助团队组织PBR，以合理的方式拆分大工作项，并确保团队成为PBR的主导者，能主动邀请用户和干系人参与，让PRB真正发挥作用。

The Scrum Masters were really diligent to help and move things forward. However, this led to compensating behavior, filling in gaps that appeared and helping to ‘push’ things forward to deliver features and fix problems. However, teams didn’t learn to self-manage this way, and didn’t take responsibility for these ‘gaps’ and kept relying on others, now on Scrum Masters instead of project managers. After a while with external help, Scrum Masters refocused and improved the basics of Scrum and LeSS to improve empiricism. One example was the improvement of Product Backlog Refinement (PBR), and helping teams how to do PBR, split big pieces of work in a good way and making sure that teams were the ones to make PBR useful, taking initiative and inviting users and stakeholders.

#### 1.3.4 检视组织设计元素：LeSS规则：大部分团队是以客户为中心的特性团队。Inspection OD-element: LeSS Rule: The majority of the teams are customer-focused feature teams.

* 在LeSS导入之初的团队自设计中，一个标准就是“独立地交付尽可能多的PBIs”。这导致团队试图拥有尽可能多的不同专业的人才，而不再专注于产品的某个特定（客户导向的）部分。一些团队开始互相学习以提升团队知识技能，例如测试人员学习编码，开发人员学习开发更多的组件。然而，也有团队仍然专注于团队内部旧有的术业专攻，这导致了大量的交接工作，要开发某些特性时的等待瓶颈，以及有限的“挑战”和尝试理解手头的特性和要解决的问题。结果是一些团队开始使用“更新的”技术来完成特性，而其他团队则继续处理他们所“熟悉”的特性，这也导致这类团队总是在处理较低优先级的PBI上，因为他们对自己处理“新”技术没有信心。显然，这不利于适应并致力于最高客户价值的工作。

In the team self-design at the start of the LeSS adoption, one of the criteria was ‘being able to deliver as much of PBI’s independently as possible’. This led to teams trying to involve as many different specialties as possible within their team, instead of focusing on a specific - customer focused - part of the product. Some teams started learning from each other to increase knowledge within their team, e.g. testers learning to code and developers learning developing on more components. Other teams still had focus within their team on their old specialties, which led to a lot of handovers in the team, bottlenecks when wanting to work on certain features and limited ‘challenging’ and trying to understand the features at hand and the problems to solve. Consequence was that some teams started working on the ‘newer’ technologies for features, while other teams kept working on features that they ‘know’. This resulted in teams working on lower priority PBI’s, because those teams didn’t feel confident to work on the ‘newer’ technologies. Obviously, this didn’t help to adapt to work on the highest customer value.

这是在LeSS导入时可能出现“错误的两分法”这一思维误区的一个很好例子：错误地从一个人或团队只知道一件事的极端，转向另一个极端，即要求团队知道“一切”。组建新团队时在客户领域上聚焦的重要程度受到学习难度的影响；在一些较小且简单的产品组中，这并不是一个顾虑。尽管我们当时还没有采用LeSS巨型，但请注意这正是LeSS巨型的动机：团队聚焦在一个相对较小的范围内，从而让团队所需的学习不会过于繁重。

This is a good example of the *False Dichotomy* thinking mistake sometimes made when adopting LeSS: incorrectly going from the extreme of a person and team knowing only one thing, to the other extreme of aiming for teams to know “everything.” The degree to which customer-area focus is important when starting to form the new teams is influenced by the difficulty in learning; in some smaller and simpler product groups this is not a concern. Although we had not adopted LeSS Huge at this point, note that this is the motivation for LeSS Huge: focusing teams within a smaller scope so that the learning required is not overwhelming.

#### 1.3.5 检视组织设计元素：LeSS规则：产品定义应该基于实际尽可能的宽泛和以用户/客户为中心。随着时间推移，产品定义也许会拓展，我们倾向于更宽泛的定义。 Inspection OD-element: LeSS rule: The definition of product should be as broad and end-user/customer centric as is practical. Over time, the definition of product might expand. Broader definitions are preferred.

宽泛的产品定义给团队具备整体产品焦点和理解带来了一些初始的挑战。这一挑战与消除大部分“完成外”的工作并将其转移到团队中（在接下来的部分详细描述）相互交织。

The broad product definition brought initial challenges for teams to have whole product focus and understanding. This was combined with eliminating most of the ‘undone’ work and bring it to the teams, for which the challenges explained in the following section.

对于组织的其他部们，宽泛的产品定义也是一个转变。以前，他们需要联系多个团队来完成工作。而现在，他们只需联系一位产品负责人，并在产品待办列表梳理中与多个团队合作。总的来说，这一转变进行得相当顺利，不过也存在一些挑战，即人们有时会直接找自己熟悉的开发者而不是向唯一的产品负责人提出意见想法。

For the other parts of the organization, the broad product definition was also a shift. Before, they had to connect to multiple teams to get things done. While now, they had to contact a single Product Owner and work with multiple teams during Product Backlog Refinement. Overall, this went quite well, though there were some challenges in people approaching developers that they knew well directly instead of bringing ideas to the single Product Owner.

#### 1.3.6 检视组织设计元素：LeSS实验：尝试...通过消除“完成外”的工作来消除“完成外”的单元。Inspection OD-element: LeSS experiment: Try…Eliminating the ‘Undone’ unit by eliminating ‘Undone’ work

在导入LeSS前，一直聚焦组件，许多活动分散在整个组织中。例如，执行回归测试、修复错误、其他支持类工作（所有这些都分散在多个组件团队中）以及测试和产品发布（单独的团队）。从LeSS导入开始，团队共同承担了这些活动。例如，支持和发布产品的工作是由团队轮流完成的（“轮流值日”），这也体现了LeSS的建议，即在特性团队之间轮流承担这些必要的专项任务（例如，处理发布、突发缺陷、改进构建系统）。团队发现他们的构建系统和自己的工程实践不能支持他们轻松地完成集成和部署工作。构建流水线没有针对整个产品进行优化，包含许多不同的代码分支，没有一个明确的主干，也没有简单的方法能将各个分支集成到主干。以前，团队没有意识要快速地集成他们的改动，因此创建了许多不同的分支，没有及时合并到主干，也没有删除过时的分支。对于使用哪个分支存在很多混淆，集成需要花费大量时间和精力。LeSS指南*持续地集成*清楚地解释了持续集成（CI）是开发者的行为。为了支持这种行为，需要有配套的流程和工具，但开发者的行为和习惯仍是能做到持续集成的主要决定因素。回归测试和缺陷修复 - 除了高紧急性的错误外 - 主要是通过（自动）选择的“值日”特性团队来完成的；如果需要的话，也会在迭代计划第一部分中进行讨论。

Before the LeSS adoption, there had been a component focus and many activities were scattered across the organization. Examples are the execution of regression tests, fixing bugs, other support (all spread across many component teams) and testing & releasing the product (separated team). From the start of the LeSS adoption, teams shared these activities. For example support duty and releasing the product were done by teams on turns (‘duty’), reflecting the LeSS suggestion of rotating any required focussed task (eg. handling release, surprise defects, improving the build system) across the feature teams. Teams found out that their build system and their own practices didn’t support them to be able to integrate easily and deploy their work. The build pipeline was not optimized for the whole product and consisted of many different branches, not a clear master branch, and no easy way to integrate into the master. Before, teams didn’t have the mindset to integrate their changes quickly, and created many different branches without merging to the master branch and removing obsolete branches. There was a lot of confusion on which branches to use and integration took a lot of time and effort. LeSS guide *Integrate Continuously* explains clearly that Continuous Integration (CI) is developer behavior. And to support this behavior the policies and tools should help, but the developer behavior and habits are still the main part of being able to integrate continuously. Executing regression tests and fixing bugs were - mostly, except for high urgency bugs - done by (automated) selection and if needed discussed in Sprint Planning 1.

由于“完成外”的工作属于团队的责任范围，团队因此承担了更多针对这类“痛点”的职责，并加强了对更宽泛产品问题的理解。团队能够对如何完成这些工作做出更多 - 通常是小的 - 改进。例如，当开发一个新特性时，他们通常会创建自动化测试，这使得回归测试变得更容易、更快和更好。以前，这些“痛点”会导致延期交付和产品质量问题，但现在所有团队都要（可以）为此承担责任，所以情况得以显著改善。尽管这些“痛点”并没有完全消失 - 即使在导入后的两年里也没有 — 但团队已经显著减少了它们，至少没有阻碍价值的交付。目前，最大的“痛点”是团队必须承担这些“职责”并致力于解决这些痛点，而不是开发（客户）特性。不过，这种情况正在慢慢改善，至少最大的痛点已经克服。请注意，这里所说的“痛点”是团队必须完成的工作，但许多“完成外”工作的消除使产品本身的痛点显著减少，这是组织设计变革的结果。

Because the ‘undone’ work was the responsibility of the teams, the teams took more responsibility for these ‘pains’ and created more understanding of broader product matters by teams. Teams could do more - often small - improvements in how these things were done. For example when they develop a new feature, often they created automated tests as well, which made regression testing easier, faster and better. Before, the pains led to delays in delivery and quality problems in the product, which is significantly better now all teams (can) take responsibility for them. Though these pains aren’t completely gone - even not after 2 years in the adoption -, the teams reduced the pains significantly and it at least didn’t block the delivery of value. Most ‘pain’ right now is for teams having these ‘duties’ and working on these pains instead of developing (customer) features. Slowly, this is improving as well, but the biggest pains are at least conquered. Note that ‘pain’ as described here is the work that has to be done for teams, but the removal of many of the ‘undone’ work made the pain for the product significantly less, as a consequence of the OD change.

#### 1.3.7 检视组织设计元素：LeSS实验：避免...职能单元 Inspection OD-element: LeSS experiment: Avoid...Functional units

在LeSS导入前存在多个职能单元，在本章节中将会对其逐一检视。在团队自设计过程中，产品总监识别出三类特定角色，他们可以加入团队或者游离于团队之外（采用自愿原则）：

* 安全专家
* 架构师
* 用户界面（UI）/用户体验（UX）专家

There were several functional units prior to the LeSS adoption, which will be inspected in this section. In the team self-design, the Head of Product identified three types of specific roles that could either join teams, or stay outside of teams (use volunteering):

* Security specialists
* Architects
* User Interface (UI)/User eXperience (UX) specialists

自从开始导入LeSS，安全专家们就决定加入（不同的）团队，并在团队之间传播安全知识，成为“常规”开发人员。他们建立了一个强大的社区，邀请所有团队派出一名代表（“安全捍卫者”）加入该社区，以分享知识并确保每个团队都了解基本的安全知识。产品总监和团队都认可这种方法，所有团队都至少能够在日常开发中满足安全的基本需求。团队将更复杂的问题带到社区中，或者将其移交给有安全专家的团队。团队对安全问题的紧迫感有所增强，这是跨团队传播知识的一大成果。

From the start of the LeSS adoption, the security specialists decided to join (different) teams and spread security knowledge across teams, being ‘regular’ developers. They set up a strong community, invited all teams to send a representative (‘security champion’) to the community, to share knowledge and make sure each team knows the basics of security. The Head of Product and teams considered this approach successful and all teams were able to address at least the basic needs in regular development on security. Teams brought more complex matters to the community or they moved it to teams with security specialists. Teams felt more sense of urgency on security, which was a great result from spreading this knowledge across teams.

架构师们在那时决定不加入团队，而是保持作为一个独立的团队。遵循LeSS*采用自愿*的导入原则，他们的工作是安全的（但角色并不安全和固定）。达成的约定是架构师不能阻碍任何团队的开发进度，如果他们想对产品有影响力，就需要与团队紧密合作。一些架构师做得相当好，但也有一些架构师不喜欢这种方式，最终选择离职。一些架构师在过程中加入了团队，并从下一个*重要的组织设计变化*(参考 [下个章节](#2-experiment-2-organizational-design-redesigning-the-feature-teams-and-removing-the-management-layer))开始，他们正式成为团队的一员。在团队中他们的知识帮助团队更好地了解产品，而架构师也可以离实际产品更近。这样，他们可以发挥更大的影响力，在整个组织中传播了更多的架构知识。

The architects decided not to join teams and stayed a separated group at that time. Following the LeSS adoption principle *Use Volunteering*, there was job safety for them (but not role safety). The agreement was that they couldn’t be blocking any developments and if they wanted to have influence on the product, they needed to work closely together with teams. Some of the architects did this quite well, and some architects didn’t like to work this way and eventually left. A few of the architects joined teams along the way, and from the next *significant OD change* (see [upcoming section](#2-experiment-2-organizational-design-redesigning-the-feature-teams-and-removing-the-management-layer)) they formally became part of a team. Their knowledge in teams helped teams to better understand the product, and the architects got closer to the actual product. This way they had much more impact, because they spread their knowledge more across the organization.

UI/UX专家在初期决定不加入团队。在后续阶段，他们曾经尝试加入团队，但团队和UI/UX专家自己都认为这不是一次成功的实验。在这次实验中，他们虽然名义上是在团队中工作，但实际上只是各自为战，并没有过多地参与团队工作。对于他们来说，他们的工作与团队工作重叠的部分并不多，而团队也并没有因为他们的加入而得到什么好处，因为他们主要在做与产品不直接相关的工作。这是大家的普遍结论，因此他们转到了公司内可以运用他们技能的其他部门。同时，一些团队也雇佣了“前端开发人员”，这些开发员能够直接参与团队的开发工作。他们的角色对团队很有帮助，让团队能更好地应对“前端”工作。

The UI/UX specialists decided not to join teams. In a later stage, they experimented to join teams, but teams and the UI/UX specialists didn’t consider it a success. In the experiment, they were working ‘in’ a team, but basically doing their own work and not getting involved in the teams much. For them, there wasn’t much overlap with the work of the teams, and teams saw no benefit in having them in the team, because they were mostly working on non-product related work. This was the general conclusion, and they moved to other parts of the company where they could use their skills. In the meantime, some teams had hired ‘frontend developers’, who were hands-on and joined development in teams. Their role was useful for teams and helped them in addressing ‘frontend’ work better.

产品负责人是产品营销团队的负责人，在组织上隶属于营销部门，不属于研发部门。产品营销团队的大多数成员都与团队紧密合作，类似于LeSS实验([《精益与敏捷开发 - 大型应用实战》](https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406))中的PO*代表*或*助理*PO。PO代表主要围绕“主题”来组织，这些主题通常是以客户为中心的特性，但也可能围绕某具体供应商的请求或缺陷。PO代表在产品待办列表梳理中扮演主要角色，在迭代计划和迭代评审中也发挥着积极作用。他们与团队一起讨论特性的重要性，并帮助团队做置换权衡。然而，PO代表仍然作为一个独立的职能单元；虽然协作有所改善，但团队无法独立完成与产品营销相关的工作，总是需要与他们合作才能交付产品。

The Product Owner was the manager of the product marketing group, organizationally located within Marketing, outside R&D. Most members of the product marketing group worked closely with the teams, similar to the PO *representative* or *Supporting* PO from the LeSS experiments ([Practices for Scaling Lean and Agile Development](https://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406)). The PO representatives organized themselves mainly around ‘topics’, often customer centric features but also e.g. around requests or bugs from specific vendors. The PO representatives took their main role in Product Backlog Refinement, but also had an active role in Sprint Planning and Sprint Review. They discussed together with teams the importance of features and helped in making trade-offs. However, they still acted as a separate functional unit and while the collaboration had improved, teams weren’t able to do the work related to product marketing themselves and always needed to work with them to get things shipped.

Scrum Master团队与研发部门协同工作，但作为一个独立职能单元存在。他们非常勤奋并一起紧密协作。然而，这也带来了一些负面影响，即他们过于关注Scrum Masters团队本身，而较少关注Scrum Master角色的其他重要方面，特别是支持产品负责人。他们对团队的主要关注点是组织和引导团队及跨团队的活动。我们与Scrum Master团队进行了一次系统建模会议，以了解当前系统和主要挑战。这使他们意识到应该关注之前未曾注意到的一些挑战。这成为他们更好地了解系统、明确要解决哪些挑战以及如何提升透明度的起点。很快，Scrum Master团队开始采取行动来提升他们想要解决的问题的透明度，特别是与产品相关的问题（主要是产品待办列表）。借助一些支持，Scrum Masters团队很快就开始关注主要挑战，而不是之前较小的关注点以及他们团队本身。

The group of Scrum Masters worked within R&D, but acted as a functional unit. They were very diligent and were closely collaborating together. A downside of that was that they were too focused on the group of Scrum Masters and less focused on other important aspects from the Scrum Master role, especially supporting the Product Owner. Their main focus to teams was to organize and facilitate team- and multi-team events. We did a system modeling session with the Scrum Master group to understand the system and the main challenges. This led them to understand that they should address certain challenges where they were not focusing on. It was a start for them to understand the system better, understanding which challenges to address and how to make these things transparent. Very soon the group started taking the approach to make topics that they wanted to address more transparent, especially around the product (mainly the Product Backlog). With some support, the group of Scrum Masters were soon focusing on the main challenges, instead of the smaller focus they had before and their own group.

考虑这些职能单元，职能专家加入团队后带来了最好的改进。避免（从而消除）职能单元的组织设计变革带来了适应性的重大改进，但也对组织产生了重要的后果。

Considering these functional units, the best improvements resulted from the functional specialists when joining the teams. The OD change to avoid (and thus remove) functional units leads to major improvements in adaptiveness, but has serious consequences in the organization.

#### 1.3.8 检视组织设计元素：LeSS实验：尝试...工作再设计 Inspection OD-element: LeSS experiment: Try...Work redesign

在开始导入LeSS时，*特性团队*把原先属于不同*组件*和*职能*的任务整合起来，工作被重新设计以涵盖以客户为中心的产品待办条目。团队最初对此感到挣扎，因为他们源自组件团队，还不习惯产品和客户的视角。在与供应商、大客户以及直接与客户和供应商打交道的内部干系人更紧密地合作一段时间后，团队更好地理解了客户领域的相关内容，“传话游戏”逐渐变少。以前，团队主要从项目经理或内部干系人那里接收工作，几乎不与真正的客户或用户互动。开始定义以客户为中心的PBIs就需要团队的学习，特别是在梳理和工作设计方面。随着时间的推移，团队在这些方面的表现越来越出色，组织设计变革的“工作再设计”最终带来了这一改进。

When starting the LeSS adoption, the work was redesigned to cover customer-centric Product Backlog Items, combining tasks (of different *components* and *functions*) in the *feature teams*. The teams struggled with this in the beginning - coming from component teams - because they weren’t used to seeing the whole product and the customer perspective. Working more closely with vendors, large customers and internal stakeholders that work directly with customers and vendors led to better understanding of the customer domain, and less ‘whispering game’. Before, teams received their work mainly from project managers or internal stakeholders, with almost no interaction to real customers and users. Starting defining customer-centric PBI’s required learning from the teams, especially in the area of refinement and work design. Over time, the teams got better at this and the OD change to redesign the work led to this improvement eventually.

### 1.4 适应 Adapt

在这个实验中的主要适应性变化总结如下：

* 一位产品负责人管理的一份产品待办列表
* 跨职能和跨组件的团队共同对整个产品负责
* 团队共同承担整个产品的共性工作（如技术支持、缺陷修复、回归测试及发布），而不是单独保留一个“完成外”单元或团队
* 团队自管理（并在这方面不断改进）

A summary of the main adaptations that happened in this experiment:

* A single Product Backlog with a single Product Owner
* Cross-functional and cross-component teams with shared responsibility for the whole product
* Teams shared the common work for the whole product (support duty, fixing bugs, regression testing & releasing) instead of having separate ‘undone’ units or teams
* Teams to self-manage (and improve in this area)

这些变化带来了以下主要结果：

* 更加注重技术卓越性
* 过了一段时间后，更加注重整个产品的发布
* 定义产品待办条目时更加以客户为中心，把组件和*职能*任务整合从而形成端到端的产品待办条目
* 团队有能力选择更多的以客户为中心的产品待办条目，并在需要时与其他团队一起协作来学习相关技能。


This brought the following main results:

* More emphasis on technical excellence
* After a while, better focus on whole product releasing
* Define Product Backlog Items more customer-centric combining component and *function* tasks in the end-to-end Product Backlog Items
* Teams being able to pick up more customer-centric Product Backlog Items and work together with other teams to learn when needed

在重新对齐工作坊之后，产品总监决定在LeSS导入过程中增加更多的外部帮助，主要侧重于指导他们的Scrum Master。通过这种方式，Scrum Master能够学习并具备能力去主动推进相关工作。也就是在这时本文的主要作者加入了Y Soft的LeSS辅导。

After the re-alignment workshop, the Head of Product decided to add external - more intensive - help in their LeSS adoption, mainly focused on the mentoring of their Scrum Masters. This way, the Scrum Masters could learn and be able to move things forward by themselves. This is when the main author came in.

根据检视结果，Y Soft在一年后希望继续向前迈进。下一步包括团队重组、取消研发部门经理角色，以及Scrum Master角色转变为敏捷教练，并招聘了在组织设计和团队辅导上更有经验的其他员工。Y Soft公司CEO和产品总监希望继续向前推进的原因有很多，包括：

Based on the inspection, after a year Y Soft wanted to make the next big step forward. This next step involved a team redesign, removing the managers within R&D and the Scrum Masters role becoming the agile coach role and getting other people onboard with more experience in organizational design and team coaching. Y Soft CEO and Head of Product had several reasons for making the next step:

* 扩大团队的自管理，减少决策延迟，提高组织的透明度。CEO决定取消产品总监与团队之间的管理层，以在组织层面对团队内部发生的事情有更高的透明度，并通过取消管理层来减少决策所需的人数（以规避决策延迟）。

* Extend self-management of the teams, remove delays in decision making and increase organizational level transparency. The CEO decided to remove the management layer between the Head of Product and the teams, to get more transparency on things that happen within teams on organizational level and less people required for decision making (to get rid of delays in decision making) by removing the management layer.

* 产品中人员（和团队）数量不断增加，各团队的规模差异很大。团队招募了新员工，并纳入了其他角色（例如架构师）。产品总监从基础设施部门为产品增加了一个全职的“团队”（仍然作为一个组件团队），基于该团队的技能，他们需要服务其他各个团队。此外，CEO和产品总监希望增加额外的团队（产能），因此启动了两个新团队（完全从一家咨询公司招聘）。

* The amount of people (& teams) in the product has grown and the teams differ greatly in size. Teams hired new people and incorporated other roles (e.g. architects). The Head of Product added a full ‘team’ to the product from the infrastructure department (still as a component team), from which the skills needed to be divided between the teams. Additionally, the CEO and the Head of Product had the desire to add extra teams (capacity), so two new teams (fully hired from a consultancy company) started.

* 团队和管理层都希望提高端到端交付以客户为中心的特性的能力。这将使团队具有更高的跨职能程度，并能够承接产品更多部分的工作。一些团队意识到，他们需要提升技能范围，以便更好地端到端交付以客户为中心的特性。这些团队中的一部分却拥有过于宽泛的专业技能，他们则需要一些客户领域的聚焦，以便能够*轻松地*变得更为完美并有重点的学习。并且不是必需能够做产品待办列表中的*任意工作*。这些团队希望改变团队设计以得到优化。这导致了对继续推进既有自上而下也有自下而上（对于大多数人而言）的支持。

* Both teams and management wanted to improve the ability of teams to deliver end-to-end customer centric features better. This would result in more cross-functionality in the teams and teams being able to work on more parts of the product. Some teams realized that they needed to improve their range of skills to be able to deliver end-to-end customer centric features better. Some of these teams had a too wide range of specialist skills, and they needed some customer-area focus to be able to *easily* get better and learn within a certain focus. And not necessarily focus on being able to work on *everything* in the Product Backlog. These teams wanted to change team designs to optimize this. This resulted in top-down and bottom-up (for most people) support for the step forward.

下一步是第二个*重大的组织设计变革*事件，以及他们LeSS导入的后续步骤。在把启动LeSS导入的初始4天活动称为“LeSS翻转”或“第一次翻转”之后，他们将这称为“第二次翻转”。基本上重复了LeSS指南*启动*中的相关步骤。以下是组织设计变革的概述：

* 团队（自我）重新设计
* 不再有直接管理团队的经理

这些组织设计变革的背景和详述将在下一节中展开。

The next step was a second event that made *significant Organizational Design changes* and next steps in their LeSS adoption. They called this ‘Flip 2’, after calling the initial 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption ‘LeSS Flip-forward’ or ‘Flip 1’. Basically, certain steps of the LeSS guide *Getting Started* were repeated. A summary of the OD changes:

* Team (self-)redesign
* No more managers directly for the teams

The context and narrative for these OD changes are described in the next section.

## 2. 实验2 组织设计：重新设计特性团队并消除管理层 Experiment 2 Organizational Design: redesigning the Feature Teams and removing the management layer

### 2.1 背景 Context
如前面的章节所述，我们提前安排了一场活动来开启下一次组织设计变革。我们已经在2020年2月 - 那时候新冠还没有流行 - 就计划了在5月11号举行该活动。产品总监决定按计划进行，因为 1）并不清楚什么时候能回归线下 2）他们不想推迟进一步改进和往前走。

As mentioned in the previous section, a new event was set forward to start the next OD changes. The event was planned on May 11th, already in February of 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. The Head of Product decided to still move on, because 1) it was not clear when it would have been possible in real-life and 2) they didn’t want to postpone the further improvements and steps forward.

发生的主要改变是：
* **团队重新设计**：大家自设计形成了“新”的团队结构。团队优化了自身结构以“交付更多端到端的客户价值”。另外，剩下的架构师们和基础服务团队也加入到团队中。
* **团队不再配置直接经理**：经理要么成为了敏捷教练，要么离开了Y Soft。团队设计了“宏观流程”来在没有经理的情况下处理比如招聘、绩效评估，以及升级等问题。
* **替换Scrum Master为敏捷教练**：产品总监认为Scrum Master的关注范围太窄了（主要在团队上），在更大的系统和组织上的关注太少。此外，有些团队曾经跟一些Scrum Master有过不好的体验。所以产品总监决定引入敏捷教练，他们是明确需要关注更广泛范围的。一些Scrum Master成为了敏捷教练，大部分Scrum Master离开了Y Soft。在接下来的章节中，会有关于这个情况及其原因的反思。

在下一个章节，将展开描述这些改变及其背后的考虑。

The main changes that happened were:

* **Team redesign**: people self-designed into ‘new’ team designs. The teams optimized themselves to ‘deliver more end-to-end customer value’. Additionally, the remaining architects and the infrastructure team people joined the teams.
* **No more managers directly for the teams**: managers became either agile coach or left Y Soft. Teams designed ‘macro-processes’ to define how e.g. hiring, performance evaluation, and escalations will be handled without managers.
* **Scrum Master role replaced for agile coach**: the Head of Product concluded that the Scrum Masters had a narrow scope of attention (mainly on teams) and too little focus on the larger system and organization. Additionally, some teams had negative experiences with some Scrum Masters, for the same reason. That’s why the Head of Product decided to start working with agile coaches that had explicitly more emphasis on a broader scope of attention. Some Scrum Masters became agile coach, most Scrum Masters left Y Soft. In the upcoming sections, there will be a reflection about this situation and reasoning.

In the next section, the narrative of these changes and the reasoning behind these changes are described.

### 2.2 详述 Narrative

在第二轮组织设计改变中重复并改进了LeSS指南*启动*中的某些步骤。至于为什么Y Soft要做这些组织设计改变，陈列如下：

* **扩大团队的自管理并移除经理**<br/>CEO和产品总监认为，经理限制了团队的自我管理能力，导致了决策的延迟以及通向团队的信息过滤。在LeSS导入的一开始，经理的角色就已经改变，他们被安排去“管理“两个跨职能团队，而不是负责某个组件或职能。经理不再对团队的结果负责。他们主要是处理人事相关的事务。然而，不同的经理工作方式不同。有些经理在处理冲突升级上非常积极，主动协调“干系人的需求”和团队的工作。另外一些经理专注于支持单个团队成员，而避免对团队日常工作产生影响。这样的行为有时会导致团队的功能失调和自管理变弱。当经理被移除后，团队的“可预测性”和产出并未因此降低。历史上，研发部门的经理是对组织其余部分的接口和冲突升级点。在没有明确的方式来支持团队、发布产品、需求排序、管理团队与组织其他团队合作的时候，移除经理角色对组织会是有害的。当它能发生的时候，是因为前面说的那些前提。
* **有职能团队加入到LeSS导入中，许多新人加入到团队**<br/>团队内部的这些改变有几个原因：团队招聘了新人、其他部门的人加入到团队、架构师们非正式地加入到团队，以及人员离职导致团队规模的变化。此外，产品总监还在LeSS导入中增加了基础设施团队，但这个团队保持了以前的组件团队设置。他们想要变得更加跨职能，而其他团队想要具备更多与基础设施相关的技能。
* **渴望改进团队的能力以更好地交付端到端的客户价值**<br/>团队普遍总结，在最初导入LeSS时团队的自设计中，他们过于注重在团队中拥有尽可能多的技能（职能和产品模块）。事后看来，团队初始自设计时的其中一个标准（能够独立地交付尽量多的PBIs）没有被足够清楚地说明。这导致团队尽量“收集”跨整个产品所有的技能，而不是看相聚合的技能集合以交付端到端特性。最终，在很多团队中，团队成员独立地工作在“任务”上，并互相交接工作。大家并不会把自己的技能教授给其他团队成员，因为他们的技能差异实在太大。

In the second round of OD changes, certain steps of the LeSS guide *Getting Started* were repeated and improved. There were a couple of reasons for Y Soft to do these OD changes, which are listed below.

* **Extend self-management of the teams and remove the managers**<br/>The CEO and Head of Product concluded that the managers limited the self-managing capabilities of the teams, caused delay in decision making and filtered information towards them. The role of the managers had already changed since the start of the LeSS adoption, where they were structured to ‘manage’ two cross-functional teams instead of their component or functional responsibility. The managers didn’t have responsibility for the results of the team. They mainly needed to deal with HR practices. However, the different managers filled in their roles in different ways. Some managers took a proactive role in escalations, negotiating between ‘stakeholder requests’ and the work of the team. While other managers focused on supporting the individual team members and stayed away from any influence on the team's daily work. Some of this behavior led to dysfunctions and less self-management from teams. When the managers were removed, there was no drop in “predictability” and output of teams. Historically, the managers in R&D were an interface and escalation point for the rest of the organization. Removing this role without having clear ways to do support, releases, prioritization, working together between teams and the rest of the organization, would have been harmful. At the time it happened, it was possible because of the pre-conditions just described.
* **Functional teams added to the LeSS adoption and many new people joined the teams**<br/>There were several causes for changing within the teams: teams hired new people, people from other departments that joined teams, architects that - informally - joined teams, and people leaving led to differences in team size. Additionally, the Head of Product added the Infrastructure team to the LeSS adoption, but still in their original setup as a component team. They wanted to become more cross-functional and other teams wanted to have more skills related to infrastructure.
* **Desire to improve the ability of teams to deliver end-to-end customer value better**<br/>The general conclusion amongst teams was that in the initial team self-design at the start of the LeSS adoption they designed too much to have as many skills (functions and parts of the product) in their teams as possible. One of the criteria for teams in the initial team self-design (‘Being able to deliver as much of PBI’s independently as possible’) wasn’t explained clearly enough, in hindsight. It led to teams ‘collecting’ as many skills as possible in their teams across the whole product, instead of looking at a good cohesion of skills to deliver features end to end. As a result, in many teams, team members were working individually on ‘tasks’ and handing over work between each other. People didn’t teach others in their teams their skills, because their skills were too different.

#### 2.2.1 准备第二场组织变更活动 Preparing the second event with organizational changes

产品总监决定第二次活动不能办得像初次LeSS导入时那样大，花费了4天，因为大家已经习惯了在一起亲密地工作。另外，新冠隔离也让办公室没人。在[这次的Less视频会议](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6MD4kW0Xwo&t=2s) 和[这个博客](https://co-learning.eu/2020/06/11/a-full-remote-highly-collaborative-teams-self-design-workshop-with-80-people-yes/)中，分享了关于Y Soft如何远程实现团队自设计的更多细节。为了更有效率地准备会议，准备本身也分成了不同的工作坊。在解释和宣布继续会议的方式后，团队被要求代表产品总监来做自我重新设计，以更好地交付端到端客户价值。公司的Scrum Master们和刚刚入职的敏捷教练一起组织了两场工作坊来帮助团队。
The Head of Product decided that this second event shouldn’t be as big as the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption, because people were already used to working closely together. Additionally, COVID-19 caused a lockdown so nobody was at the office. In [this LeSS conference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6MD4kW0Xwo&t=2s) and in [this blog](https://co-learning.eu/2020/06/11/a-full-remote-highly-collaborative-teams-self-design-workshop-with-80-people-yes/), more details are shared about how Y Soft did the team self-design remotely. To have an effective preparation, the preparation was splitted in different workshops. After the explanation and the announcement of the way forward, the teams were asked on behalf of the Head of Product to re-design themselves to be able to deliver end-to-end customer value better. The Scrum Masters and the onboarded agile coach organized two workshops to help teams do this.

**团队设计工作坊 1**
**Team design workshop 1**

工作坊的目标：形成团队设计（草案）并发现团队交付端到端特性的可能性。
Goal of this workshop: form (draft) team designs and learn about the possibility of end-to-end feature delivery by teams.

团队在三个不同的地方为同一个产品工作。最大办公场所（包含50%以上的团队）中的团队已经开始计划改进现有的团队设计。在这个计划中，一些团队成员会过来帮助准备工作坊。这些团队成员提供了很重要的输入，例如目前（草案中）团队的当前状态和常见的团队大小。
There are three sites with teams working on the product. On the biggest site (more than 50% of the teams), teams already started an initiative to improve the current team designs. From that initiative, a couple of team members helped in preparing for the workshop. Important input from these team members was e.g. the current status of the (draft) teams and the most common team size number.

我们发现：因为这三个办公场所的大小不一样（工作坊之后一个地方有8个团队，而另外两个地方分别有2个和3个团队），我们本可以有区别地去准备工作坊和参与工作坊。对于最大的场所，每个人加入哪个团队的团队讨论太复杂了。对于其他两个场所，团队明显更少地参与了部分自设计的迭代。对于未来类似的情况，基于不同地点的团队规模，应该考虑如何让小地点更好地参与，并仍然让他们参与决定如何最好地优化由各团队组成的整个大团队。
Learning: because the 3 sites differ in size (8 teams after the workshop on one site and 2 + 3 on the two other sites), we could have differentiated the way the 3 sites were preparing and participating in the workshop. The individual team discussions about who would be in which team, were complexer for the biggest site. For the two smaller sites, the involvement from teams in some parts of the self-designing iterations was significantly smaller. For similar future situations with differences in size of sites, it would be good to consider how smaller sites would participate, but still include them in deciding how the team of teams as a whole would optimize best.

我们故意将团队设计工作坊分成了两个工作坊。在同地办公的团队设计中，团队成员经常在开会间隙讨论团队设计。在以前的团队设计中，我们学习到的是在两个迭代中间空出30分钟来使这一切发生。否则的话，这些讨论会在工作坊结束之后进行，并且团队也会随之改变。在远程情况下，这样在休息时间的聊天非常难以实现。于是我们在第一次和第二次工作坊之间空出来一周，这样团队成员可以反思并讨论关注点和开放性问题。
We split the team design workshop in two workshops on purpose. In co-located team designs, team members often chat in breaks about the team design. Learning from previous team designs is to take 30 minutes breaks between iterations to let that happen. Otherwise, these discussions will happen after the workshop and teams will change afterwards. Remotely, this chat in breaks is hard to accomplish. We organized a week between the first and second workshop, so team members could reflect and discuss open issues or concerns.

我们用Miro来引导工作坊所有的步骤。每一步，参与者在Miro画布上移动并增加/改变内容。最多的时候，Miro有95位参与者同时在线。最重要的引导提示：不要中心化的讨论。用其他技巧来处理，比如在分组讨论之后用5分钟或者10分钟来朗读输入的内容或者使用便利贴对其提问。
We used Miro to facilitate all steps in the workshop. During each step, the participants themselves were moving in Miro and adding/changing things. At maximum, 95 people were active in Miro at the same time. Most important facilitation tip: don’t have central discussions. Use other techniques for that, like taking 5 or 10 minutes after each breakout session to read the results or adding questions in sticky notes to someone else’s input.

在第三轮的自设计过程中，为了帮助团队反思自己交付以客户为中心的端到端特性的能力，团队对产品待办列表上的工作做了一次练习。敏捷教练和Scrum Master们在Miro白板上准备了一些史诗（注意：一个史诗就是Y Soft产品待办条目的集合，遵循用于PBL的工具）。每一个团队都可以指出他们是否能够端到端交付那个史诗，或者希望交付并从中学习。团队们在主板上评估他们可能交付的史诗并在上面贴一张绿色的便利贴（我们可以端到端交付它）或者一张橙色的便利贴（我们希望可以端到端交付它并从中学习），详见[附件](#team-design-workshop-1) 。在此之前，已经清楚说明后期不会用这个结果来看哪些团队可以交付哪些史诗。有些团队害怕这种透明会用来事后的挑战：他们为什么不愿在一些特定的史诗上工作。当然，如果团队愿意，他们自己事后可以使用这些练习的成果。
To help the teams reflect on their ability to deliver customer-centric features end-to-end,  in the third round of the self-design, teams did an exercise on the work of the Product Backlog. A selection of the epics (*note: an ‘epic’ is a cluster of PBI’s together in Y Soft, following the tooling they use for the PBL*) were prepared on the Miro board by the Scrum Masters and agile coach in a table. Each team could indicate whether they can deliver that epic end-to-end or were willing and able to learn it. Teams evaluated the possible epics for their team and added a green sticky note (we can deliver it end-to-end) or an orange sticky note (we are able and willing to learn to deliver it end-to-end) to the main table, see [appendix](#team-design-workshop-1) for more info. In advance, it was made clear that the results wouldn’t wouldn’t be used afterwards to see which teams could deliver which epics. There was fear of some teams that this transparency would be used to challenge them later why they wouldn’t work on a certain epic. Of course, teams could use the outcomes of the exercise themselves afterwards if they wanted to.

参与者最后附上一个对团队设计可能的关注点。这个输入被团队成员使用，但同时也是产品总监在第一轮和第二轮工作坊之间的工作内容。
Participants ended with adding one possible concern for the team design. This input was used by team members, but also by the Head of Product to work on during the time between the first and the second workshop.

**团队设计工作坊 2**
**Team design workshop 2**

工作坊目标：最终确认团队设计并识别未来改进持续学习的步骤
Goal of this workshop: finalize the team design and identify follow-up steps to improve continuous learning for the future.

在两个工作坊中间间隙的那一周，参与者讨论了团队设计的许多开放式结局。有些团队太大了，同时还有些人还没有加入任何团队。产品总监确认有些人没有加入团队也是可以的，不能够强迫团队接受他们不想要的团队成员。产品总监，敏捷教练和Scrum Master们对当前的状态非常了解，并通过跟合适的人沟通来帮助推进工作坊之间的事情。
In the week between the two workshops, participants discussed many open ends of the team designs. Some teams were too big and some people didn’t have a team yet. The Head of Product addressed that it could be a valid outcome that someone wasn’t part of a team, and teams shouldn’t be forced to include members in their team they didn’t want to. The Scrum Masters, agile coach and Head of Product had a good overview on the status and helped by talking to the right people to get some things moving in between the workshops.

第二场工作坊跟第一场的结构类似。人们在工作坊之间用线上合作工具来推进他们团队设计的更新。在总结状态和一个新的迭代之后，参与者收集阻碍性的关注点。这里有一个短暂的分组会议，让参与者投出唯一一个阻碍性的关注点。渴望加入其他团队的某个人生病了，所以两个团队都不想做出最终决定。他们都同意在这个人回归之后再解决这个问题，所以这两个团队重新投票的结果是：在这个行动之后，需要另一个自设计的迭代吗？大部分人的回答是不要（只有两个人想要另一个自设计的迭代。这也是团队的最终决定。
The second workshop had a similar structure to the first one. People used the online collaboration tool in the time between the workshops to keep progress of changes in their team design. After a summary of the status and a new iteration, the participants collected blocking concerns. There was a short breakout session about the single blocking concern that was voted as blocking by the participants. One person that was desired to move to another team was sick and therefore both teams involved didn’t want to make the final decision. They agreed to solve this when this person was back, and teams voted again: ‘after this action point, is there another iteration of self-design needed?’ The answer was no by a large majority (just 2 people wanted another iteration of self-design) and the team design was final.

在工作坊的结尾，人们识别了三种下一步的类别，1）当前立马解决 2）下一个新迭代解决 3） 下两个迭代解决
At the end of the workshop, people identified three types of next steps, 1) needed to address on event, 2) needed to address in the first new Sprint, 3) needed to address in the follow-up two Sprints.

#### 2.2.2 第二次组织设计变革活动 Second event with organizational design changes

组织设计变革活动的开始启动了新团队的工作且是无经理的工作。活动本身基本上是一整天的“庆祝”，也是一个的新阶段的正式开始。因为新冠，这个活动也是远程的。
The start event for the OD changes kicked off the work in the new teams and working without managers. The event itself was mostly a day of ‘celebration’ and a formal start of a new step. Due to COVID-19, also this event was remote.

CEO启动了活动，他感谢每一个人积极的参与，和对Y Soft的成功以及整个战略的重要贡献。他详细解释了公司战略中的变化，以及为什么所有团队对这些变化的理解是重要和必须的。他也谈论到了“无经理”组织，因为从那个时候开始，产品研发中的所有经理已经被移除了。团队自己取一个团队名字（如果他们想也可以加一个团队标识），并讨论对他们重要的团队价值，如何合作，如何确保（互相）学习。团队，和伙伴团队一起，解决了如何建立快速响应的团队角色来让新团队加速。
The CEO kicked off the event by thanking everyone for their active participation and important contribution to the overall strategy and success of Y Soft. He explained more about the changes in the company strategy and the importance and need for all teams to understand this. He also talked about the ‘manager-less’ organization, because from that moment all managers in product development were removed. Teams came up with a team name (and a logo if they wanted) and discussed important team values for them, how they collaborate, and how they make sure they learn (from each other). Teams solved - with buddy teams - how to handle the fast-response team role to get new teams up to speed.

没有了经理，团队构想出“宏观流程”，以前让经理负责的事务，从现在开始由团队自己负责。宏观流程的例子包括新员工入职，和招聘新员工。团队利用这个时间来选择最重要的宏观流程，建立团队间如何处理宏观流程的草案。
Without managers, teams came up with ‘macro-processes’ that are important aspects that used to be taken care of by managers that teams have to take care of themselves from now on. Examples of macro-processes are ‘on-boarding of new employees’ or ‘hiring new employees’. Teams used the time to choose the most important macro-processes to make a draft on how to deal with the macro-processes among teams.

第二天早上，新团队开始了第一个迭代的迭代计划。团队们被要求全员参与（而不是派遣代表），有两个原因：

* 当团队成员还互相不了解对方的技能时，他们可以一起讨论来选择产品待办条目
* 产品负责人（仪式前一个月）已经为即将到来的下一阶段准备了更具战略性的大纲

The morning after, the first Sprint with the new teams started with Sprint Planning. Teams were asked join with the whole team (instead of only representatives), for two reasons:

* For teams with people that don’t know each other’s skills well yet, they can discuss together to select PBI’s.
* The Product Owner (starting a month the event) had a more strategic outline for the upcoming period prepared.

在迭代计划之后，团队转移到他们的迭代计划2中，并按照新的设定开始合作。
After the Sprint Planning, teams moved to their Sprint Planning 2’s and started working together in the new set up.

更多关于第二部分启动仪式的信息在[这个附件](#appendix-d-preparation-and-start-event-of-the-second-experiment-of-od-changes)。
More info on the second start event can be found in [this appendix](#appendix-d-preparation-and-start-event-of-the-second-experiment-of-od-changes).

#### 2.2.3 组织设计元素 Organizational Design elements

组织设计实验中组织元素的总结和简短阐述：
A summary and short elaboration of the OD-elements that were involved in the OD experiment:

* *LeSS规则：大部分团队是以用户为中心的特性团队。*
* *LeSS Rule: The majority of the teams are customer-focused feature teams.*

通过前面的组织设计实验中的检视结果，团队尝试涵盖尽可能多样的专家，却导致合作和学习非常有限，以及团队内部过多的交接形成了瓶颈。在第二次团队自设计中，团队练习了工作在产品待办列表上，来评估他们是否可以端到端交付一个特定的一大块工作（“史诗”），或者希望交付和从中学习。这样帮助团队关注在产品待办列表中特定的部分（专门针对客户领域），而不是练习尝试拥有产品待办条目中尽可能多的技能。另外，在团队自设计中，Y Soft的架构师们正式加入到团队中。这些实践型的架构师自我发展，并向团队传授更广泛的产品知识。
As inspected upon from the previous OD experiment, teams tried to involve as many different specialties as possible within their, which led to limited collaboration and learning, and a lot of handovers in the team with bottlenecks. In the second team self-design, teams did an exercise on the work of the Product Backlog to evaluate whether they could deliver a certain big piece of work (‘Epic’) end-to-end in their team or were willing and able to learn it. This helped the teams to focus on certain parts of the Product Backlog (specializing in customer domain), instead of trying to have skills for as many Product Backlog Items as possible. Additionally, in the team self-design, the architects that were still at Y Soft formally joined the teams. These were hands-on architects that developed themselves and taught teams the broader product.

前面组织设计实验里的[这个章节](#125-organizational-design-elements) 介绍了这条LeSS规则。
Introduction on this LeSS Rule in [this section](#125-organizational-design-elements) of the previous OD experiment.

* *LeSS实验：尝试...扩展产品的定义*
* *LeSS experiment: Try...Expanding Product Definition*

最初的产品定义常常不够完美。通过扩展产品的定义——通过改进完成的定义——组织级的改进得以发生。团队学习或者增加他们不曾拥有过的技巧。这个第二次组织设计实验，在LeSS导入范围之外的基础设施团队参加了团队自我设计，技术设施团队的成员加入到特性团队中。这样，产品完成的定义得到了延伸，部分以前没定义成完成的工作进入团队。
The initial product definition is often less than perfect. By expanding the product definition - by improving the Definition of Done - organizational improvement happens. Teams learn or add skills that they didn’t have before. In this second OD experiment, the infrastructure team that was outside the LeSS adoption joined the team self-design and people moved to the feature teams. This way the Definition of Done of the product extended and part of the undone work was included in the teams.

前面组织设计实验里的[这个章节](#125-organizational-design-elements) 介绍了这个LeSS实验。
Introduction on this LeSS Experiment in [this section](#125-organizational-design-elements) of the previous OD experiment.

* *LeSS指南：在客户领域中选择专业化*
* *LeSS guide: Prefer Specialization In Customer Domain*

对特性团队的一个普遍误解是，它会导致特性团队完全放弃专业化。专业化是多维度的，不止是技术，还有客户领域。客户领域的专业化（对团队来说可能随时间而变化），常常意味着在特定技术（复数）中偶然的专业化。团队在技术上并不专业化，但需要尝试在团队中拥有非常多的专长来有能力合作在用户特性上，从而限制了团队在客户领域的专业化。在第二次组织设计实验中，团队反思了他们可以（并愿意）工作在哪种特性上，以便在特定的客户领域中专业化。
A common misunderstanding of feature teams is that it leads to abandoning specialization altogether. Specializing is multi-dimensional, not only on technology but also on customer domain. Specializing in a customer domain (that might change over time for a team), often means *accidental specialization* in certain technology (*plural*) for the same type of features for that customer domain. The teams didn’t specialize in technology, but rather tried to have too many specialisms in their team to be able to collaborate on customer-features, limiting specialization on customer domain. In the second OD experiment, teams reflected on which types of features they were able (and willing) to work on, to specialize in a certain customer domain.

* *LeSS指南：经理是非必需的*
* *LeSS guide: Managers Are Optional*

在LeSS中，经理是非必需的。经理可以发挥一个有用的角色，但大部分（大型）组织没有经理角色和位置的短缺。在一个LeSS组织中，更倾向于把责任转移给团队，而不是分配给经理这个角色。在第二次组织设计实验中，团队已经没有了经理，只有产品总监，但他并不承担大部分传统经理的责任。这些责任现在由团队承担，团队和HR紧密合作。这个指南与LeSS实验 *尝试...尽可能保持组织扁平* 相关
In LeSS, managers are optional. Managers can perform a useful role, but most (large) organizations have no shortage of manager roles and positions. In a LeSS organization, the preference is to move responsibility to teams instead of assigning them to manager roles. From the second OD experiment, there were no managers for the people in the teams, there was only the Head of Product, but he wasn’t dealing with most of the traditional management responsibilities. These responsibilities were now for the teams, with close collaboration from the teams with HR. This guide is related to the LeSS experiment *Try...keep the organization as flat as possible*.

* *LeSS实验：尝试...让HR参与*
* *LeSS experiment: Try... Engage HR*

HR实践在许多组织中是一个主要障碍，仅有一小部分成功地改变了HR的实践。传统HR实践关注在个人，而敏捷开发团队才是驱动者，这导致了系统冲突。为了培养真实团队，HR实践必须要改变，比如奖励和绩效评审。为了做到这点，让HR专家参与是非常重要的，并教育他们为什么敏捷开发会影响HR的实践。在Y Soft，HR专家（包括招聘）在第二次组织设计实验的准备中就开始与团队紧密合作。比如，招聘新成员和升职。从那开始，团队不得不与HR紧密合作，而HR也很好地参与了团队的工作并支持到了团队，比如招聘新员工。在[这个章节](#235-inspection-on-od-element-less-guide-managers-are-optional)，分享了更多关于团队如何在没有经理的情况下工作的细节。我们尝试的LeSS其中一个实验就是这个 *尝试...团队自己做招聘*。
HR practices are a major obstacle in many organizations, only a few have succeeded in changing HR practices. Traditional HR practices focus on *individuals*, while in agile development *teams* are the driver, which causes systemic conflict. To foster real teams, HR practices need to change, like rewarding and performance review. To be able to do that, it’s important to engage HR specialists, and educate them why agile development affects HR practices. In Y Soft, HR specialists (including recruitment) started to work closely with the teams in the preparation of the second OD experiment. Teams became responsible for many prior management responsibilities and thus needed to work with HR. For example, hiring new people and promotions. From then on, they had to work closely with HR and HR was well involved in the work of the teams to be able to support them, e.g. for the recruitment of new people. In [this section](#235-inspection-on-od-element-less-guide-managers-are-optional), more details are shared about how the teams worked without managers. One of the experiments from LeSS that were tried for this is *Try...Team does the hiring*.

* *LeSS实验：避免...与绩效相关的激励*
* *LeSS experiment: Avoid... Incentives linked to performance*

（个人）与绩效相关的激励是基于旧的假设，人们可以控制他们的绩效并被奖金所激励。这里的建议是“把工资和任务分开”（[来源](https://www.alfiekohn.org/punished-rewards/)）。在第一次组织设计实验中，我们曾经尝试通过奖励团队来促进团队合作。然而，这些依然是与绩效相关的激励，效果并不完美。此外，有些经理仍然对个人的绩效进行“嘉奖”，即使没有真正的奖励。从第二次组织设计实验开始，不再有与绩效相关的激励，无论是个人还是团队。当组织表现很好，所有团队拿到同等的奖金，团队可以在团队内部分配奖金。在LeSS中与这个相关的实验是 *尝试...用奖励团队代替奖励个人* 并 *避免...绩效考核*。
(individual) Incentives linked to performance are based on old assumptions that people are in control of their performance and are motivated by rewards. Recommendations are there to *‘decouple the task from the compensation’* ([source](https://www.alfiekohn.org/punished-rewards/)). In the first OD experiment, there were attempts to give team rewards that helped team collaboration. However, these were still incentives to performance, which didn’t work perfect. Additionally, some of the managers were still ‘rewarding’ performance of individuals, even though there was no real incentive for it. From the second OD experiment forward, there were no more incentives linked to performance, individual or team. Teams could distribute bonuses within their team once in a while, when the organization had done well and all teams got equal bonuses. Relevant experiments from LeSS in this regard are *Try...Team incentives instead of individual incentives* & *Avoid... Performance appraisals*.

检视LeSS原则中[组织设计原则](https://less.works/blog/2020/03/02/more-with-less-seven-tools-for-simplifying-organizations.html) *以小为大*：
Inspecting at the [organization design principles](https://less.works/blog/2020/03/02/more-with-less-seven-tools-for-simplifying-organizations.html) from the LeSS principle *More with LeSS*:

我们使用以下组织级设计原则来减少LeSS组织的规模：
1. 从专家角色到团队：在第一次组织设计实验中，团队已经成为了组织构建的基本模块。在第二次组织设计实验中，团队自己领导并成为承担责任的基石这件事变得简单，因为团队已经习惯承担责任并共事。
2. 从资源思维到人性思维：Y Soft的HR和产品总监，从第一次组织设计实验中学习到，要更多地关注在团队需要和人的需要上，因为团队作为组织构建的基本模块，能够把人们的感觉和他们的需要变得透明。
3. 从“围绕技术来组织”到“围绕客户价值来组织”：在第一次组织设计实验中，这个被重新构造，并且在第二次组织实验中没有实质性地改变。但是，团队增加了对客户领域的学习，比如与大客户紧密合作，开发某些以客户为中心的特性。
4. 从独立团队到持续跨团队协作：在导入LeSS的开始，团队关注在自己的工作上。渐渐地，他们在大特性开发中开始合作。特别是当公司战略（因为新冠而）改变，从而产品待办列表巨变时，团队需要在新的战略和新的技术上一起发现和学习。这大概是在第二次组织设计实验中，重新设计帮助团队更好地关注在这上面。
5. 从“协调是为了集成”到“通过集成实现协调”：因为在第一次组织设计实验中，这还是一个挑战，见[这个章节](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work)。因为团队在所有产品相关的工作上变得更加负责，他们开始为了持续集成而改进前提条件和行为。在第二次组织设计实验中，团队也持续工作在改进技术卓越性和他们的集成行为上。
6. 从项目到产品：随着时间的推移，团队不再接受来自外部的需求。这一点也没有因为第二次组织设计实验而改变，也是从第一次组织设计实验中延续下来的。
7. 从许多小产品到少数宽泛的产品：在第二次组织设计实验中，产品的定义没有改变。但是，为了让产品的定义更宽泛，通过把基础设施团队引入到特性团队中，完成的定义也被扩展。


We use the following organizational design principles to descale into LeSS organizations:

1. From Specialist Roles to Teams: already in the first OD experiment, teams became the organizational building block. For the second OD experiment, teams took the lead and the basic foundations of taking responsibility were easy because teams were used to taking responsibility and working together.
2. From Resource-Thinking to People-Thinking: learning in the first OD experiment, Y Soft HR and Head of Product were focusing more on what teams and people need, since the teams as basic building blocks created transparency on how people felt and what they needed.
3. From Organizing around Technology to Organizing around Customer Value: in the first OD experiment this was restructured, and in essence this hasn’t changed in the second OD experiment. However, teams increased their learning in the customer domain and e.g. worked closer with large customers on certain customer-centric features.
4. From Independent Teams to Continuous Cross-team Cooperation: at the start of the LeSS adoption, teams focused on their own work. Increasingly, they started collaborating more on large features and worked on those together. Especially when company strategy changed and as a consequence the Product Backlog changed a lot (due to COVID-19), teams needed to work together to discover and learn what’s needed in the new strategy and technology. This was around the second OD experiment, and redesigning helped the teams to focus on this more.
5. From Coordinate to Integrate to Coordination through Integration: since the first OD experiment, this was still a challenge, see also [this section](#136-inspection-od-element-less-experiment-tryeliminating-the-undone-unit-by-eliminating-undone-work). Because teams became responsible for all product-related work, they started improving the preconditions and behavior to integrate continuously. Teams continued to work on improving technical excellence and their integration behavior, also in the second OD experiment.
6. From Projects to Products: over time, no more requests from the sideline were coming to the teams. This didn’t change because of the second OD experiment, but continued from the first OD experiment.
7. From Many Small Products to a Few Broad Products: the product definition didn’t change for the second OD experiment. However, by adding the people from the infrastructure team into the teams, the Definition of Done extended to make the product definition broader.

### 2.3 检视 Inspect

#### 2.3.1 第二次组织设计实验中的一般检视 Generic inspection of the second OD experiment

前面组织设计实验包含了组织设计上的深刻变革。因此，就减少了对这次组织设计实验的检视。通常在第二次组织设计变革中值得检视的主题是从Scrum Master到敏捷教练的转换。
The prior OD experiment involved more profound changes on the OD. Consequently, there is less to inspect on for this OD experiment. A topic worth inspecting on c is the move from Scrum Masters to agile coaches from the second OD change forward.

为什么是敏捷教练而不是Scrum Master？在特定的时间，产品总监总结道，Scrum Master的关注范围太窄了（主要在团队上），在更大的系统和组织上的关注太少。此外，有些团队因为一些原因，曾经跟一些Scrum Master有过不好的体验。所以产品总监决定启用敏捷教练，他们明显更强调关注在更大的范围上。所有的Scrum Master必须申请成为这个角色。
Why agile coaches and not Scrum Masters? At a certain point, the Head of Product concluded that the Scrum Masters had a too narrow scope of attention (mainly on teams) and too little focus on the larger system and organization. Additionally, some teams had negative experiences with the Scrum Masters, for the same reason. That’s why the Head of Product decided to start working with agile coaches, that had explicitly more emphasis on a broader scope of attention. All Scrum Masters had to apply for this role.

*反思*：对Scrum Master这个角色有一些误解，定义敏捷教练的角色主要是意味着Scrum Master的角色定义是合适的。此外，Scrum Master工作范围太窄的问题是可以预防的。Scrum  Master们在导入LeSS的开始几乎没有得到过外界的帮助，所以他们不能够关注在（系统级的）重要变量上。他们主要关注在团队上，并与产品负责人以及其他组织中的重要变量在产品待办列表（和其他相关的活动）上没有任何互动。当密集的（外部）监控和教练开始实施，以及工程副总裁（已作为敏捷教练）也成为团队中的一员后， 这些Scrum Master便有所改进。然而在其他人的眼中，伤害已经造成。在第二次组织设计（除了1之外）中，产品总监宣布组织中不再有Scrum Master的岗位之后，Scrum Master可以加入团队或者尝试在组织中找到其他的位置。在后来的阶段中，在Scrum Master们离开之前，产品总监宣布部分Scrum Master可以申请成为敏捷教练。这表示Scrum Master们已经学习并作出改进，因为在早期阶段产品总监没有宣布这件事。不幸的是，（大部分）Scrum Master并不喜欢一开始对待他们的方式，并决定离开。
*Reflection*: there was a misconception about the role of the Scrum Master, and defining the role of the agile coach basically meant that the role of Scrum Master was defined properly. Additionally, the problem of Scrum Master having a too narrow scope should have been prevented. The Scrum Masters had almost no outside help from the start of the LeSS adoption and therefore were unable to focus on the (systemic) important variables. They mainly focused on teams, had almost no interaction on the Product Backlog (and activities related to that) with the Product Owner and other important variables in the organization. The Scrum Masters improved when more intensive (external) mentoring and coaching started and the Vice-President of Engineering became part of their group (already in the role of agile coach). However, for the perception of others the damage was done. After the clear announcement from the Head of Product that there was no place for the existing Scrum Masters after the second event (except for 1), they could go to teams or try to find another place in the organization. In a later stage - before the Scrum Masters left - the Head of Product announced that some of the Scrum Masters could apply to become agile coach. This indicated that the Scrum Masters had learned and improved, because he didn’t announce this in an earlier stage. Unfortunately, (most of) the Scrum Masters didn’t like the way they were treated with the initial announcement and decided to leave.

如果Scrum Master们可以在导入LeSS的一开始就被密切地帮助过，或者在后面的阶段也可以，这种情况本可以避免。他们热切又有才华，仅仅缺乏经验和支持。Scrum Master是假定用来帮助组织级变更和解决问题的，但因为缺乏经验和支持，他们没有做这些事情。产品总监没有理解这一点，也没有帮助Scrum Master做这个。相反，是通过快速并糟糕的方案，引入一个新角色，来解决问题。敏捷教练就像Scrum Master在LeSS和Scrum里一样表现，因此在LeSS导入时并不需要敏捷教练。
If the Scrum Masters would have been helped more intensively from the start of the LeSS adoption - or even in a later stage - this could have been prevented. They were all eager and talented, but just missed experience and support. Scrum Masters are supposed to help in organizational changes and problems, but weren’t doing that because of a lack of experience and support. The Head of Product failed to understand this and help the Scrum Masters to do this. Instead, the problem was solved by the quick and dirty solution of introducing a new role. The agile coaches are acting like the Scrum Masters should act in LeSS and Scrum, and therefore there are no agile coaches needed in a LeSS adoption.

只有一个Scrum Master变成了敏捷教练，关注在技术教练上，其他所有的Scrum Master都离开了Y Soft。其中一个Scrum Master为了帮助组织而停留了一段时间。一位经理成为了敏捷教练，工程副总裁成为了敏捷教练，而其他敏捷教练是从公司外部招聘的。
One Scrum Master became an agile coach - focused on technical coaching - and the other Scrum Masters left Y Soft. One Scrum Master stayed for a while to help. One of the managers became agile coach, the Vice-President of Engineering became agile coach and the other agile coaches were hired from outside the company.

在经理被移除之前，Y Soft已经有简单的职位描述，没有在产研中区分专业。开发工程师可以在他们升职的时候晋升一个级别，但其他角色基本上跟以前的职业路径一样。跟非常像LeSS实验 *尝试...创建唯一职位名称* 并 *尝试...不同级别的通用头衔*。
Before the managers were removed, Y Soft already had simple job descriptions that did not distinguish specialisms within R&D. Developers could basically step up a level when they were promoted, but their roles were basically the same according the career paths. Very much like the LeSS experiments *Try... create only one job title* and *Try... generic titles with levels*.

#### 2.3.2 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS规则：大多数团队是以客户为中心的特性团队 Inspection OD-element: LeSS Rule: The majority of the teams are customer-focused feature teams.

团队变革的根本原因，是可以预防的。在团队内部和团队之间，对持续学习的缺乏和对协同学习的缺乏，应该得到更多的关注，特别是来自Scrum Master的关注。在LeSS导入开始的4天活动中，太多的注意力放在每个团队拥有（几乎）全部的技能上面，所以许多团队还为成为一个真实的团队并能够做到端到端交付而挣扎。更好地支持Scrum Master也可以预防这一点。
The root causes that led to the change of teams, could have been prevented. The lack of continuous learning and lack of collaboration on learning within and between teams, should have been given more attention, especially by Scrum Masters. In the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption, there was too much focus on getting (almost) all the skills in each team, and therefore many teams struggled in truly working as a team and being able to deliver end-to-end. Supporting the Scrum Masters better could have helped prevent this as well.

团队内部学习变得越来越跨职能和跨组件，本应该是首次导入的一部分。虽然有部分团队在这方面有所成长，大部分并没有。在这个时期，团队关注在学习支持任务，做回归测试，解决程序问题，和发布。虽然这非常重要，也是获得整个产品关注的主要因素之一，但是团队在组内合作、以及分享商业领域和组件知识上的关注度十分有限。
Learning within the teams to become more cross-functional and cross-component, should have been more part of the adoption in the first place. Although some teams grew in this, many teams didn’t. In this period, teams focused on learning support tasks, doing regression tests, fixing bugs, and releasing. Though this was very important and one of the main factors to get whole product focus, teams had limited focus on collaboration and sharing knowledge on business domains and components within the team.

在第二次组织设计变革的准备中和工作坊期间，我们关注并鼓励了团队学习。团队识别了不能够共同跨职能地交付价值的根本原因。在这次仪式中，团队识别了在团队内部和团队之间的学习领域，以防止类似的事情在未来发生。
In the preparation for the second event with OD changes and in the workshops itself, there was focus and encouragement on team learning. The teams identified the root causes for the inability to cross-functionally deliver value together. In the event, teams identified areas for learning in their team and between teams to prevent this for the future.

正式加入团队的架构师们在团队中实战，他们中的大部分也会帮助其他成员理解产品更大的范围和产品整体，特是跟产品相关的新技术部分。
The architects that formally moved into the teams worked hands-on in the teams, and most of them focused also on helping other teams to understand the bigger picture and whole product, especially related to new technology that was involved.

#### 2.3.3 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS指南：*尝试...扩展产品的定义* Inspection on OD-element: LeSS guide: *Try...Expanding Product Definition*

在第二次组织设计实验中，曾经排除在外的基础设施团队参与了自设计并加入到了各特性团队中。这样产品完成的定义被扩展，一部分以前没定成完成的工作也包含在了这些特性团队的工作中。
In this second OD experiment, the infrastructure team that was outside the LeSS adoption joined the team self-design and people moved to the feature teams. This way the Definition of Done of the product extended and part of the undone work was included in the teams.

在LeSS导入之时，基础设施团队是在产品团队之外的一个独立的（*组件*）团队。在团队自设计中，原基础设施团队成员分别加入到了三个特性团队中，这三个特性团队都至少拥有2个基础设施团队的成员，以防止他们被其他团队成员孤立。我们没有对这个迁移做单独评估，但同时也没有过关于它的任何争议。基础设施的工作成为了产品待办条目和完成的定义的一部分，有些团队会接手更多基础设施相关的工作，因为这些工作跟他们关注的特定的（客户）领域相关，且是必需的。一种产品定义的扩展非常丝滑地发生了，因为人们很好地融入了团队并非常渴望让这一切成功。
The infrastructure team was a separate (*component*) team outside the product for the teams that worked in the LeSS adoption. In the team self-design, the members of the former infrastructure team moved to three of the feature teams, every team having at least two people of the former infrastructure team, to prevent being isolated in the team. There was no specific evaluation of this move, but there was never an issue raised about this. Infrastructure work became part of the Product Backlog Items and the Definition of Done, and some of the teams took more infrastructure related work because of their focus on certain (customer) domains that needed infrastructure work. An extension of the product definition that worked smoothly, because the people that were involved integrated well in the teams and were eager to make it a success.

#### 2.3.4 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS指南：*在客户领域选择专业化* Inspection on OD-element: LeSS guide: *Prefer Specialization In Customer Domain*

大概在第二次组织设计实验的时候，发生了一个战略级的变更（因为新冠），也导致了产品待办列表的大范围变更，包括对不同技术的不同关注点。最初有三个团队，稍后有四个团队关注到了这个（客户）领域，他们跨团队紧密合作并学习了新的客户领域。这是一个在（新）客户领域中专业化的成功案例。
Around the start of the second OD experiment, a strategic change was made (due to COVID-19) which led to large changes of the Product Backlog, involving a different focus with different technology. Three teams initially and a bit later a fourth team focused on this (customer) domain, collaborating intensively cross-team and learning the new domain. This was a good example of specialization in a (new) customer domain.

然而，从某个时刻开始，这个领域成为了产品待办列表的主要部分，更多的团队需要参与进来。让其他团队参与这个新领域新技术中，需要大量的学习和协作。
However, at some point, this domain became the prevalent part of the Product Backlog and more teams needed to be involved. It took quite some learning and collaboration to have the other teams involved in this new domain and technology.

#### 2.3.5 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS指南： *经理是非必需的* Inspection on OD-element: LeSS guide: *Managers Are Optional*

在没有硬指标的情况下来反思工作中有经理和没有经理的区别是非常困难的。事实是团队交付产品待办条目的数量和以前一样（在团队规模相同的情况下）。平均每个团队少一点，但总体数量是一样的，因为团队更小了。在几个迭代之后，交付的产品待办条目数量提升到了以前一样的水平。虽然产出（完全）不应该成为目标，这也表示了在没有经理的条件下产出没有变化，新组建的团队甚至没有过产出降低。
It’s hard to reflect on the difference between working with and without managers with hard metrics. Fact is that the amount of PBI’s the teams delivered in their new teams was similar to their old teams (with the same amount of people). A bit less per team, but an equal amount because there were smaller teams. After a few Sprints, the number of PBI’s that had been delivered had increased. Although *output shouldn’t be a goal* (at all), it gives an indication that output doesn’t change because there are no managers, and with newly formed teams there wasn’t even a decrease.

Y Soft 如何推进自我管理，如何处理曾经由经理们领导的跨团队（甚至跨部门）的主题，都非常值得学习。在Y Soft，这些主题被称为“宏观流程”（比如升级，招聘，解雇）。宏观流程是为了设计如何让所有团队在没有经理的情况下，保持这些主题的运行。一些主题，例如招聘，团队在考虑宏观流程的各种约束条件之后，自己内部决定他们怎么做。基本上，是这个团队的特殊宏观流程。
The way Y Soft promoted self-management and dealt with cross-team (and even cross-department) topics that used to be led by managers are very interesting to learn from. These topics are called ‘macro-processes’ (e.g. escalations, hiring and firing) within Y Soft. The macro-processes were there to design how this would work for all teams and be able to keep these topics moving without managers. For some topics - like hiring - teams decided within their own team how to do it, considering the constraints from the macro-process. Basically, this would be the micro-process for the specific team.

大体上，团队的志愿者，产品总监，以及敏捷教练的代表建立了如何实施宏观流程的指引。一个志愿小组（主要是团队成员，还有其他相关干系人，或者当需要的时候可以是产品负责人）设计最初的也是最重要的宏观流程。受到LeSS全景图的启发，每个主题：志愿小组定义主题的原则和规则。这些规则可以是真实的约束（比如HR对申请人的反馈时间），也可以是跟志愿小组一起确定的，以保证对一个主题的统一性。基于原则和规则，志愿者们设计了团队应对主题的指南。跟LeSS指南的开启一样，基于实验的学习，团队可以基于自己的情况做出调整。在指南完成以后，宏观流程（基于原则、规则和指南）被所有团队讨论，或发送（依赖主题是什么）给所有团队以得到回复。
Volunteers from teams, the Head of Product, and a representative from the agile coaches created guidelines on how to deal with macro-processes in general. A volunteering group (mostly team members, but also other relevant stakeholders or the PO if needed) designed the first and most important macro-processes. It was inspired by the LeSS Complete Picture for each topic: the group defined the principles for the topic and made rules for the topic. These rules could be real constraints (e.g. response time to applicants by HR) or made together with the volunteering group to make sure there is some uniformity for a topic. Based on the principles and rules, the volunteers designed guides to use within teams to deal with the topic. Similar to the LeSS guides to start with something and based on learning in experiments, teams could adjust to their specific situation. After the guides were finished, the macro-processes (basically the principles, rules & guides) were discussed or sent around (depending on the topic) for feedback from all teams.

*宏观流程是如何被诠释的*
*How the macro-processes were explained*

设计这些宏观流程大部分是团队的责任，因为他们是设计者，也是责任人。在[这个博客](https://www.daretothinkbyg.com/en/blog/manager-less-rnd-how-to-promote-people-1)，有Y Soft 团队如何应对升职的例子。
Designing these macro-processes created more responsibility in the teams, because they were the people that designed them and were responsible for these topics. In [this blog](https://www.daretothinkbyg.com/en/blog/manager-less-rnd-how-to-promote-people-1), there is an example of how the Y Soft teams dealt with promotions.

##### 2.3.5.1 产品总监离开Y Soft且没有替代者 Head of Product leaving Y Soft and was not replaced

大概一年半以后，产品总监离开了Y Soft。需要做出一个选择：招聘一位新的产品总监或者CEO担任产品总监。招聘新产品总监产生的风险是，这位新人可能想要改变一些事情，因为他以前并不是设计组织中的一员。在咨询了一部分团队成员之后，CEO决定，不再招聘产品总监，并且试图使他和团队之间没有任何经理。为了应对这个，HR在系统中拥有了一个正式的角色，例如，给新人签订合同（而不是产品总监），一个来自产研团队外部的人承担了产品总监的角色，来进行采购和管理供应商（例如，招聘外部人员加入团队），这是一个相对其他组织来说，比较限制的角色。直到这天（2023年春），Y Soft也没有新的产品总监。CEO似乎也没有因为产品总监的离开而增加工作量，因为团队承担了额外的工作（见上面章节的宏观流程），HR也跟团队一起负责HR的事务，在产研团队中的那位负责了采购和供应商管理。无论如何，CEO已经常规性地参加迭代回顾，当需要的时候有时还会参加产品待办列表的梳理，以及频繁参加迭代计划，提供业务更新。这并没有因为产品总监的离开而改变。显然，产品负责人也没有增加额外的工作，因为产品总监并没有加入到产品和产品愿景中。
Around 1.5 years later, the Head of Product left Y Soft. A choice had to be made: hiring a new Head of Product or the CEO acts as the Head of Product. A risk of hiring a new person is that a new person might want to change things, because that person wasn’t part of the design of the organization. The CEO decided - after consultation with some team members - to work without a Head of Product and try to work without any managers between him and the teams. To deal with this, HR got a formal role in the system around e.g. offering a contract to new people (instead of the Head of Product) and one person outside the product within R&D took the role of the Head of Product to deal with procurement and suppliers (e.g. for hiring external people in the teams), which was a relatively limited role compared to most other organizations. Until this day (Spring 2023), there hasn't been hired a new Head of Product. It turned out that the CEO didn’t have additional work because of the Head of Product leaving, because of the additional responsibilities teams took (see macro-processes section above), HR being involved more in HR matters with teams and the person in R&D taking care of procurement and suppliers. The CEO joined Sprint Review regularly anyway, sometimes Product Backlog Refinement when useful and on a frequent basis he started the Sprint Planning with a business update. This didn’t change because of the Head of Product leaving. Obviously, there was no additional work for the Product Owner as well, since the Head of Product wasn’t involved in the product and vision for the product.

#### 2.3.6 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS实验：尝试...让HR参与 Inspection on OD-element: LeSS experiment: Try... Engage HR

在检视前面组织设计元素的过程中，HR这个角色帮助团队应对没有经理的情况。CEO明确了他对HR的期望，以及在LeSS导入中希望HR与团队合作的结果。HR非常支持团队，跟团队一起紧密合作。当需要招聘新人时，团队与HR一起设计了宏观流程。在这些宏观流程中，他们对由谁负责和有什么约束达成了协议。比如团队需要对每一份职位申请在24小时内做出反馈，并跟申请人沟通他们的决定。HR负责发布招聘信息和搜索新的人选，团队负责面试。团队和HR都喜欢这种工作方式，根据（被聘用的和未被聘用的）申请人的反馈，招聘的质量也有所提高。
In the inspection of the previous OD-element, the role of HR to help teams deal with working without managers came forward. The CEO set clear expectations with HR and what he expected from them for working with the teams in the LeSS adoption. HR was supportive and worked closely together with teams. For the hiring of new people, the teams designed a macro-process together with HR. In these macro-processes, they made agreements who took responsibility for what and what the constraints are. For example teams have to respond within 24 hours when a new candidate submits their application, and teams communicate to the applicant about the decision. HR does the recruitment and searches for new people that teams can interview themselves. Teams and HR like this way of working, and the quality of e.g. hiring improved based on feedback from applicants (hired and not hired).

#### 2.3.7 组织设计元素的检视：LeSS实验：避免...与绩效相关的激励 Inspection on OD-element: LeSS experiment: Avoid... Incentives linked to performance

在第二次组织设计实验中，已经没有了与绩效相关的激励，无论是个人还是团队。当组织做得好的时候，所有团队拿到平等的奖励，跟绩效没有关系，团队可以在内部分配奖金。有些团队在团队内部实验过不同的奖金分配的方式，在某些情况下，团队奖金分配并不平等。然而，大部分团队在内部平均分配奖金。再也没有了跟绩效相关的加薪和其他奖励。到了某个时刻，CEO发现公司薪酬低于市场水平，他大幅提高了产研团队所有人的薪酬，超过了市场平均薪酬水平。从那时起，开始了跟绩效无关的定期加薪。团队内部和团队之间没有了竞争关系，大家感觉到了薪酬的平等，并知道当他们值得的时候，有相关的流程获得晋升。
From the second OD experiment forward, there were no more incentives linked to performance, individual or team. Teams could distribute bonuses within their team once in a while, when the organization had done well and all teams got equal bonuses, not linked to performance. Some teams experimented with different ways of distributing bonuses *within* the team and in some cases teams distributed the bonus unequally. However, most teams distributed the bonus equally within the team. There were no salary increases or any other incentives linked to performance. At one point, the CEO found out that the compensations were below average compared to the market, and he increased the compensations massively for everyone in R&D to get above average. From that point on, there were regular pay raises not linked to performance. There was no competition between teams or within teams, people felt fairly compensated and knew there is a process to get promoted when they deserved it.

### 2.4 适应 Adapt

这次实验中主要适应的总结如下：
* 重新设计跨职能和跨组建的团队，让他们可以单个团队交付端到端产品待办条目（不意味着：所有团队都可以端到端地完成所有产品待办条目）
* 剩下的架构师正式加入到各特性团队中
* 解散独立的基础设施团队，团队成员加入到常规团队中
* Scrum Master被敏捷教练所取代
* 移除所有经理，除了产品总监以外
* 团队奖金跟单个团队的绩效没有联系

A summary of the main adaptations that happened in this experiment:

* Re-designed cross-functional and cross-component teams to enable the ability to deliver Product Backlog Items end-to-end by a single team (not meaning: *all teams can do all Product Backlog Items end-to-end*)
* The remaining architects joined the teams formally
* The separate infrastructure team was resolved and the people joined the regular teams
* The Scrum Master role was replaced by the agile coach role
* Removal of all managers except for the Head of Product
* Team bonuses without connection to performance of the single team

这带来了以下主要结果：
* 一些Scrum Master离开了，一些经理变成了敏捷教练
* 团队自我管理提升，需要额外强调这一点
  
This brought the following main results:

* Some Scrum Masters left and some other managers became agile coach
* Increased self-management by the teams and additional emphasis on this

从导入LeSS的一开始，许多组织设计改变就发生了，并在接下来的几年中，还有许多小的改善。这些并不显著，但Y Soft保持改进，以提升和改进团队的责任感，让他们在没有经理的条件下工作。同时也改进了与组织其他部分的合作，比如产品营销，（本地）支持和销售。
Many OD changes happened since the start of the LeSS adoption, and many small things were improved in the course of the following years. These were less significant, but Y Soft kept improving to increase and improve the responsibility of the teams and work without managers. As well as improving the collaboration with other parts of the organizations like product marketing, (local) support and sales.

CEO在LeSS导入的早期，第二次组织实验之前，表达了将SAFEQ迁移到LeSS Huge的愿望。Y Soft有增加市场份额和也许扩张市场的野心。迁移到LeSS Huge应该可以帮助他们实现这一点，包括增大团队规模。
The CEO indicated the desire to move to LeSS Huge for SAFEQ early in their LeSS adoption, before the second OD experiment. Y Soft has the ambition to grow their market share and possibly extend markets, and the move to LeSS Huge should help to be able to grow on this, including the growth of the number of teams.

比较显著的调整是Y Soft的联合创始人成为了SAFEQ的产品负责人。他非常有经验，跟（打印）供应商/合作伙伴以及大客户关系亲密，对产品了如指掌，因为他曾经就是（跟CEO一起）的初代开发工程师，对产品和代码一直都非常清楚。当他成为产品负责人后，我们对愿景的理解，对基于供应商和客户需求优先顺序的清晰度都得到了提升。因为得到了授权（他的决定也受到尊重），他不会因为组织“需要”，包括来自（打印）供应商和客户的反馈和学习，而改变方向，这会减少团队因切换客户领域而产生的认知负荷。团队没有了紧急需求，可以更加专注，即使我们有10个团队共同工作在一个产品待办列表上。一个连贯的产品愿景，清楚的优先顺序，产品负责人与团队良好的合作，改善了团队（感觉）的关注度。自从这个产品负责人，和一个组织内经验丰富的*助理PO*，加入到产品团队之后，内部干系人和外部客户的满意度更高了。团队有了更好的基线以方便未来的改善，更明白应该关注什么地方，以及为了长期利益应该学习什么。
A significant adaptation was the co-founder of Y Soft becoming the PO for SAFEQ. He is experienced, has close contact with (print) vendors/partners and large customers and knows the product in and out, because he did initial development (with the CEO) and stayed close to the actual product and code. When he started as the PO, the understanding of the vision, clarity on priorities based on vendor and customer became higher. Because he has the mandate (and his decisions were respected), he wouldn’t change direction often based on “demands” from the organization, which limited the cognitive load for teams to switch between customer domains. Including adapting to feedback and learning from (print) vendors and customers. Teams didn’t have the urge anymore to have more focus, even when there were 10 teams working together on the Product Backlog. A consistent product vision, with clear priorities and a good collaboration between the PO and the teams improved the (feeling of) focus for teams. Since this PO - and a *Supporting PO* with a lot of experience in the organization - joined the product, there was more satisfaction from internal stakeholders and external customers. Teams had a better baseline to improve further and knew better where to focus on and what to learn for the long-term.

在之前有关于迁移到LeSS Huge的多次讨论。敏捷教练和这个（新）产品负责人讨论把SAFEQ迁移到LeSS Huge的原因和后果。他们得出的结论是，迁移的原因是产品负责人无法理解SAFEQ的客户和市场的所有需求，进而不知道从中长期来说，应该关注在什么地方。（2021年春）讨论的时候，SAFEQ刚刚增长到了11个团队，而产品负责人表示他能够监管客户和市场的需求，以及产品待办列表的大部分主题。他提到，通过推进主题（发现和交付），以及必要时跟内部干系人和合作伙伴一起梳理的产品待办条目，团队已经成长得不错。可能他对产品、市场和重要供应商和客户的经验和知识帮助他有这个见识。如果在未来，他无法监管这些，就可以迁移到LeSS Huge中去。
The discussion about moving to LeSS Huge had happened a few times before. The agile coaches discussed with the (new) Product Owner the reasoning and consequences of LeSS Huge for SAFEQ. They concluded that the main reason for moving to LeSS Huge would be the inability for the Product Owner to understand all customer and market needs for SAFEQ and as a corollary know where to focus on for the mid-long term. At the time of discussion (Spring 2021), SAFEQ had just grown to 11 teams, but the Product Owner concluded that he could still oversee the customer and market requests and the main topics of the Product Backlog. He mentioned that teams had grown in moving topics forward (discovery & delivery) and refined PBI’s with internal stakeholders and partners well when necessary. His experience and knowledge of the product, market and important vendors and customers probably helped in him having this overview.  If he cannot oversee it anymore in the future, a move to LeSS Huge can happen then.

*反思*：尽管在LeSS规则中说过LeSS Huge是为了8个以上的团队，然而团队的数量不应该成为迁移到LeSS Huge（甚至分割成两个产品）的原因。人们能够共同合作的人数有限，但这个限制是基于上下文的，取决于产品本身，人的知识，复杂性，公司规模等等。第二，当整个产品——在这里几乎是整个组织——的规模在8个左右（比如13个，但不是50那么多），应该对为什么团队合作是一个问题的原因做深入分析。可能有更重要的根本原因需要解决，而不是“太多团队一起工作”。然而，当决定转变成两个产品的时候，并没有对这个问题做更深入的根因分析。例如，缺乏去分享好的产品愿景，频繁调整需求优先顺序，以及客户反馈的延迟。
*Reflection*: Even though in the LeSS rules it states that LeSS Huge is for ‘8’+ teams, the number of teams shouldn’t be the main reason to move to LeSS Huge (or split into two products). There is some limit for the amount of people that work together, but this limit is contextual and depends on the product, the knowledge of people, the complexity, the size of the company, and more. Second, when the whole product - which in this case is almost the whole organization - is around this number of 8 (13,  and not e.g. 50), there should be dived into the root cause why teams working together is perceived as a problem. There are probably root causes that are more important to address than only ‘too many teams working together’. However, there was no deeper root cause analysis on the problems with this at the time of deciding to move to two products, e.g. the lack of sharing a good product vision, too often changing priorities and the delay of customer feedback.

## 3. Moving to two products
## 3. 转向两个产品

Deciding on the product definition is an important aspect of *organizational design*, because of the organizational consequences related to the definition. This section discusses the product definition and the decision to move to two products. The discussion focuses on the impact of the product definition for the optimization goal *to be adaptive to discover highest customer value or delight*. This section complements the OD evaluation of the previous sections.
因为产品定义会带来相关的组织后果，决定产品定义是*组织设计*的一个重要方面。这章将讨论产品定义及转向两个产品的决策。讨论聚焦在产品定义对*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*这一优化目标的影响。这章补充了前面章节的组织设计评估。

### 3.1 Context
### 3.1 背景

As described in the previous section, there was a consideration about moving to LeSS Huge several times. At some point, Y Soft introduced OMNI Series, which was a result of the development from the Product Backlog of SAFEQ: a hardware device to be able to connect printing devices to many kinds of environments, e.g. Microsoft 365, even when the printing device was not equipped to connect with Cloud environments. The customers of OMNI Series are the actual end customers and users of printing devices, while SAFEQ was sold as a package (embedded) on vendor’s devices including the software. That meant the customers and needs were different and as a consequence, the sales channels were different (direct sales vs. selling through a partner/vendor). The used technology was different (*note: not as much as assumed, see [inspection section](#33-inspect)*), and this made the CEO, strategist and VP of all products decide to split the two products. There was a move to two products, with a single Product Owner and a single Product Backlog per product. The teams already working on OMNI Series moved to work on the Product Backlog for OMNI Series (3 teams), and the other teams moved to work on the Product Backlog for SAFEQ (10 teams). The first Sprint for the new products started in November 2020. In this section, there is a focus on the move to two products.

如前面章节所述，我们多次考虑转向LeSS巨型。在某个时候，Y Soft推出了OMNI系列，这是来自基于SAFEQ产品待办列表开发的结果：一种能够将打印设备连接到多种环境（如Microsoft 365）的硬件设备，即使打印设备未配备与云环境连接。OMNI系列的客户是打印设备的实际最终客户和用户，而SAFEQ是作为包（嵌入）在供应商的设备包括软件上销售的。这意味着客户和需求不同，因此销售渠道也不同（直销与通过合作伙伴/供应商销售）。使用的技术不同（*注：没有假设的那么多，请参阅[inspection section](#33-inspect)*），这让CEO、战略规划师和所有产品VP决定将这两个产品分开。由此我们转向两个产品，每个产品有一个产品负责人和一份产品待办列表。已经在OMNI系列上工作的团队转向工作于OMNI系列的产品待办列表（3个团队），而其他团队转向工作于SAFEQ的产品待办列表（10个团队）。新产品的第一个迭代从2020年11月开始。在本章中，重点介绍向两个产品的转变。

In summary, the CEO and a few other senior managers from e.g. marketing reasoned 1) the products have different customers and a different marketing channel and 2) the focus on both products should be higher.

总的来说，CEO和一些其他来自诸如市场的高管认为：1）两个产品有不同的客户和不同的营销渠道，2）需要对这两个产品更聚焦。

### 3.2 Narrative
### 3.2 详述

The CEO and VP of sales have the ambition to grow their market share rapidly in the coming years and be a technology leader in their market. Y Soft has many market opportunities and they want to be able to respond to these. Subsequently, opportunities change often due to changing conditions (COVID-19 is the most  relevant example) and existing customers wish change as well to the existing product(s). Being able to respond to the desires of existing customers is important, considering Y Soft’s historic strength to quickly fulfill (customized) customer needs. To be able to meet these ambitions, product development needs to be able to adapt to the desired changes.

CEO和销售VP有志于在未来几年迅速扩大市场份额，成为市场的技术领导者。Y Soft有很多市场机会，他们希望能够响应这些机会。之后，机会经常因条件的变化而变化（新冠疫情是最相关的例子），现有客户也希望对现有产品进行更新。考虑到Y Soft历史上一直有快速满足（定制）客户需求的优势，能够响应现有客户的诉求非常重要。为了能实现这些愿望，产品开发要能适应所需的变化。

From the second event with organizational changes, there were 13 teams defined in product development. When moving to 11 & 12 teams, feedback from the teams was that they didn’t have enough focus on a certain domain and had to switch too often between priorities. In other words: cognitive overload. The reasoning in Y Soft was that a split to LeSS Huge (and later: to move to 2 products) would help teams to have focus on a certain customer domain. Therefore, the CEO wanted to move to LeSS Huge and be able to have more overview and more focus on a certain (customer) domain for the teams. Their reasoning was that working in one Requirement Area would enable a better overview and more focus on a certain domain, without losing the whole product focus and collaboration with the other teams. There is a reflection on this reasoning later in this section.

从组织变革的第二次活动开始，在产品开发中定义了13个团队。当增加到11、12个团队时，来自团队的反馈是他们没法对某个领域有足够的聚焦，不得不经常在优先级之间切换。换句话说：认知过载。Y Soft的考虑是拆分为LeSS巨型（后来转向两个产品）将有助于团队聚焦于某个客户领域。因此，CEO希望转向LeSS巨型，以使团队能够对某个（客户）领域有更多的了解和聚焦。他们的考虑是工作在一个需求领域能够在某个领域获得更好的了解和聚焦，同时不失去整体产品焦点和与其他团队的协作。本章稍后将对此考虑进行反思。

When the second event took place in May 2020, simultaneously the senior management prepared an update of the company strategy. Teams already worked on some of the product development towards this updated strategy, but because of COVID-19 in March 2020, the update of the strategy - and the accompanying development - accelerated. Customers & vendors in the ‘printing’ industry obviously had different requirements, since many people started working from home. Additionally, senior management took this as a suitable time to update the company strategy and accelerate the progress towards the corresponding goals.

当第二次活动于2020年5月举行时，高管同时准备了公司战略的更新。团队已经为这一更新的战略进行了一些产品开发，但由于2020年3月新冠疫情的影响，战略以及伴随着的开发的更新都加快了。因为许多人开始在家工作，“打印”行业的客户和供应商显然有了不同的需求。此外，高管将此视为更新公司战略并加快实现相应目标的合适时机。

The update of the company strategy was a more explicit focus on products. The CEO communicated very clearly that Y Soft is a product company and therefore should focus on product(s). The strategy can be summarized as:

公司战略的更新更明确地将重点放在了产品上。CEO非常明确地表示Y Soft是一家产品公司，因此应专注在产品上。该策略可以概括为：

* Simplifying the products that are offered to customers (e.g. pricing, installation, infrastructure)
* Enabling new customer features with new technologies
* Offering new features to different market segments, mainly to Small & Medium Businesses (SMB’s)

* 简化向客户提供的产品（例如，定价、安装、基础设施）
* 利用新技术实现新的客户特性
* 为不同的细分市场提供新特性，主要面向中小型企业

This changed the Product Backlog significantly but also introduced the use of new technologies that were not known by the teams. As a consequence, the teams needed to learn new technologies ánd new markets to be able to pursue the new targets.

这不仅大大改变了产品待办列表，还引入了使用团队不知道的新技术。因此，团队需要学习新技术和新市场才能实现新目标。

Three teams already worked - mainly - on OMNI Series from the single Product Backlog, so they moved to work on the OMNI Series product. The other ten teams worked on SAFEQ already, so they moved to work on SAFEQ. When OMNI Series was introduced to the single Product Backlog (before the move to two products), teams that liked to work on the OMNI Series product, already started working on that voluntarily. The teams discussed whether it was needed that the three OMNI Series teams would still need to help out on certain standard SAFEQ work, but the teams decided it wouldn’t make much sense to do that and even in the short term it wouldn’t be necessary.

三个团队已经主要在做来自于单一产品待办列表的OMNI系列相关的工作，所以他们就转到了OMNI系列产品。其他十个团队已经在做SAFEQ相关的工作，所以他们就转到了SAFEQ产品。当OMNI系列的工作被引入到单一产品待办列表时（在转向两个产品之前），想要工作在OMNI系列产品上的团队已经主动地开始在这上面工作。团队讨论了是否仍然需要三个OMNI系列团队帮助完成某些日常的SAFEQ工作，但团队认为这样做没有多大意义，即使在短期内也没有必要。

#### 3.2.1 Reasoning to split into 2 products
#### 3.2.1 考虑拆分成2个产品

Y Soft’s product development has grown over time, because of Y Soft’s ambition to grow rapidly, be a technology leader, and be able to respond to market opportunities quickly. The change of strategic direction transformed the items on the Product Backlog massively (up to 70%), including fundamental changes in the use of technology. Y Soft’s reasoning to move to two products could be categorized in two categories: 1) reasoning to ‘split’ the work into smaller focus of attention (either in Requirement Areas or separate products) and 2) reasoning whether the product is one or two products from customer and market point of view.

Y Soft的产品开发随着时间的推移在增长，因为Y Soft渴望快速发展，成为技术领导者，并能够快速响应市场机会。战略方向的改变极大地改变了产品待办列表上的条目（高达70%），包括使用技术的根本变化。Y Soft转向两个产品的考虑可分为两类：1）考虑将工作“拆分”成较小的关注焦点（需求领域或单独产品）；2）考虑从客户和市场的角度来看是一个还是两个产品。

##### Weak product vision and frequent change of priorities on the short term
##### 薄弱的产品愿景和短期内优先级的频繁变更

Senior management wanted to use a roadmap to keep discussing the next steps without losing long-term objectives. Before the second event with organizational changes (May of 2020), the CEO asked the Product Owner to come up with a ‘year-long roadmap’ of the product, to be able to identify upcoming needs for the product and analyze where to focus on with the organization. Creating this roadmap took almost a year. As a consequence, the Product Owner (*note: this was before the co-founder became Product Owner*) and product marketing people that supported the PO had little focus on (customer) domains while the roadmap was created. The CEO and other board members explained clearly - e.g. in Product Backlog Refinement - the direction they wanted to go with the product. However, the Product Owner wasn’t able to explain this product vision clearly to teams. He focused on - short term - customer deadlines, and missed transparency and explanation for the long-term. This resulted in a non-consistent vision of the future and (too) often a change of priorities. Additionally this prevented teams from choosing a (customer) domain to focus on.

高管希望使用路线图以在不失去长期目标的情况下继续讨论下一步行动。在组织变革的第二次活动（2020年5月）之前，CEO要求产品负责人制定一个产品的“整年路线图”，以便能够识别产品的未来需求，并分析组织应聚焦在哪里。制定这个路线图花了将近一年的时间。因此，产品负责人（*注：这是在联合创始人成为产品负责人之前*）和支持他的产品市场人员在路线图被制定的过程中几乎没有关注（客户）领域。CEO和其他董事会成员清楚地解释了 - 比如在产品待办列表梳理中 - 他们想要的产品方向。然而，产品负责人无法向团队清楚地解释这个产品愿景。他专注于短期的客户截止日期，而忽略了对长期愿景的透明度和解释。这导致了对未来的愿景不一致，而且（太）经常改变优先级。此外，这还阻碍了团队选择聚焦一个（客户）领域。

The change of strategic direction reinforced the inability to share a consistent product vision for the long term by the Product Owner. The Product Owner and the supporting product marketing people needed to shift their attention to different customer needs, different customer segments, and the use of new - for Y Soft mostly unknown - technology, also from a customer perspective as a result of the strategic direction. Additionally, the PO and the supporting product marketing people were busy trying to learn what features were needed, tried to be in touch with customers and vendors, but mainly had to discuss internally with e.g. sales and support what would be needed. Other people in the company - e.g. sales & support - were involved a lot in getting the work more clear and helping to decide what should be next, and joined PBR often, to help teams to get more understanding on the upcoming work. However, the unknowns reinforced the struggle of the Product Owner to create a product vision and decide on what to work on next for the Product Backlog.

战略方向的改变放大了产品负责人在分享一致的长期产品愿景上的能力不足。由于新的战略方向，产品负责人和支持他的产品市场人员需要将注意力转向不同的客户需求、不同的客户细分市场，以及使用新的技术（对于Y Soft来说基本都是未知的）。此外，PO和支持他的产品市场人员忙于了解需要什么特性，试图与客户和供应商保持联系，但主要还是与内部诸如销售和支持部门讨论需要什么。公司的其他人，如销售和支持人员，参与了大量澄清工作，并帮助决定下一步应该做什么；他们经常参加PBR，以帮助团队对接下来的工作有更多了解。然而，诸多未知让产品负责人在创建产品愿景和决定产品待办列表中的下一项工作上越发挣扎。

##### Cognitive Overload for the teams
##### 团队的认知过载

Teams complained they changed focus on a specific domain every (few) Sprint(s), which made it harder for them to learn in a specific (customer) domain. Actually, it was cognitive overload, needing to learn too many different things in too short a time, which they felt as a lack of focus. Main reason for the cognitive overload was the lack of sharing a good product vision and consistency on the Product Backlog as a result. However, senior management’s assumption was that making the span of attention smaller for teams, would help teams with the cognitive overload by creating more focus for the teams. With the desire to grow and add more teams in the future, moving to LeSS Huge and later moving to two products seemed a logical step for Y Soft, because of the assumption that a smaller span of attention would increase the focus and reduce the cognitive overload as a result.

团队抱怨说他们每隔（很少）几个迭代就会改变在一个特定领域上的聚焦，这让他们很难学习一个特定的（客户）领域。事实上，这是认知过载，也就是在太短的时间内需要学习太多不同的东西，让他们感到缺乏聚焦。认知过载的主要原因是缺乏对好的产品愿景的分享以及由此带来的缺乏在产品待办列表上的一致性。然而，高管的假设是，通过让团队的专注范围变小，由此为团队创造更多的聚焦，将帮助团队应对认知过载。对Y Soft来说，因为有这样的假设 - 较小的专注范围会增加聚焦从而减少认知过载，想要未来发展和增加更多团队，转向LeSS巨型并随后转向两个产品似乎是合乎逻辑的一步。

The main root cause for the cognitive overload was the weak product vision and the - too often - changing priorities in the Product Backlog, described in the previous section. Teams needed to learn new types of work associated with the change of strategic direction: cloud-related activities to make sure SAFEQ would run in the cloud and OMNI Series which included both the development on a hardware device and the use of new software technologies, partially for a new market. The consequence for teams was that teams needed to learn a lot on these new technologies and understand different customer needs. By often changing priorities, teams had to learn too many different things in a too short time, cognitive overload. To be able to develop these new PBI’s, teams had to learn both from a perspective of different technologies (and different use of those technologies by customers) and a new type of device with different product features than they were used to.

如之前章节所述，认知过载的主要根本原因是薄弱的产品愿景和产品待办列表中太过频繁变化的优先级。团队需要学习与战略方向变化相关的新型工作：与云相关的活动以确保SAFEQ将在云上运行，OMNI系列包括硬件设备上的开发和新软件技术的使用，部分用于新市场。结果就是团队需要学习很多关于这些新技术的知识，并了解不同的客户需求。由于经常改变优先级，团队不得不在太短的时间内学习太多不同的东西 - 认知过载。为了能够开发这些新的产品待办条目，团队必须从不同技术（以及客户对这些技术的不同使用）的角度学习，还要学习具有与他们之前接触的不同产品功能的新型设备。

A smaller but relevant other factor was that teams had to get used to working closely with more other departments than before. Especially in PBR - but also in Sprint Review - many people from e.g. sales and support joined. The complication was that stakeholders didn’t have a consistent interpretation of the product vision, and when stakeholders joined they sometimes argued about the direction to follow (even within PBR). This is a consequence of the lack of sharing a good product vision. The different interpretations and the lack of clarity - because when starting development there was no direct customer feedback - it was hard for teams to understand which decisions to make in the actual development and they needed to learn and interpret many different things. A strong and consistent product vision - and less changing of priorities - could have created more clarity on what to learn to reduce the cognitive overload. Teams could have focused on specific domains or technologies to learn, which would have increased their focus and reduced the cognitive overload.

一个较小但相关的其它因素是团队必须习惯于与比以前更多的其他部门密切协作。特别是在PBR中 - 但也发生在迭代评审中 - 许多来自销售和支持部门的人加入了进来。复杂的是干系人对产品愿景没有一致的解释，他们加入有时会争论要遵循的方向（甚至在PBR活动中）。这是缺乏分享好的产品愿景所导致的结果。不同的解释和缺乏清晰度 - 因为在开始开发时没有直接的客户反馈 - 让团队难以理解在实际开发中应该做出哪些决定，他们需要学习和解释许多不同的东西。一个强大且一致的产品愿景 - 以及更少的优先级变化 - 本可以让团队更清楚地了解应该学习什么，从而减少认知过载。团队本可以聚焦在特定的领域或技术上学习，通过增加聚焦来减少认知过载。

##### Having many teams & desire to add more teams in the future
#### 有许多团队并希望在未来增加更多团队

The desire to add more teams in the future was not the main reason to split into two products, but certainly a characteristic senior management took into account. They reasoned that a split into Requirement Areas/move to LeSS Huge (that was the initial idea, before moving to two products) would help in the ambition to increase the number of teams.

想要在未来增加更多的团队并不是拆分成两个产品的主要原因，但高管肯定也考虑到了这一点。他们认为拆分成需求领域/转向LeSS巨型（那是在转向两个产品之前最初的想法）将帮助到追求增加团队数量的目标。

At the moment of the discussion to move to two products, there were 13 teams working from the single Product Backlog. Because of the rule of thumb of having a maximum of “8” teams working from a single Product Backlog, senior management used this rule of thumb as a reason - though not the main reason - to split into two products. The valid reason to move to LeSS Huge is when the Product Owner starts to get overloaded and cannot oversee the market, stakeholders and Product Backlog anymore. The number of “8” is a common heuristic for when overload of the Product Owner starts to happen.

在讨论转向两个产品时，有13个团队工作于单份产品待办列表。由于存在一个最多能有“8”个团队工作于单份产品待办列表的经验法则，高管将其作为拆分两个产品的原因（尽管不是主因）。转向LeSS巨型的合理原因应该是当产品负责人开始超负荷，无法再全面看管市场、干系人和产品待办列表。“8”这个数字只是一个对产品负责人会开始超负荷的常用经验值。

##### Different customers, markets and sales channels
##### 不同的客户、市场和销售渠道

In the end, the main reason they used to split into two products was the difference in customers, markets and sales channels between SAFEQ and OMNI Series. Senior management learned from the development of OMNI Series and SAFEQ that these products are very different from the perspective of customers, markets and sales channels (B2B vs B2C), and this resulted in the discussion whether to split into two products. The CEO, strategist and VP of all products’ additional underlying assumption was that there was almost no collaboration needed between the two products. Therefore, there would be no need and desire to share learnings between the products and as a consequence no need to optimize for cross-learning.

最终，他们用来支持拆分成两个产品的主要理由是SAFEQ和OMNI系列在客户、市场和销售渠道方面的差异。高管从OMNI系列和SAFEQ的开发中了解到这些产品从客户、市场和销售渠道（B2B与B2C）的角度来看非常不同，这引发了是否拆分成两个产品的讨论。CEO、战略规划师和所有产品VP的另一个基本假设是这两个产品之间几乎不需要协作。因此，就不需要或希望在两个产品之间共享知识，从而也就不需要为交叉学习去优化。

#### 3.2.2 关于多个产品的LeSS视角和如何定义一个产品

For context: this section focuses on the optimization goal of *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight* that LeSS uses. For other optimization goals, *other reasoning might be consistent and working*, but since this is the optimization goal for LeSS, this section focuses on that.

作为背景：本节重点讨论LeSS使用的*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*这一优化目标。对于其它优化目标，*另外的考虑可能是与其一致和有效的*，但由于它是LeSS的优化目标，本节将重点讨论这一点。

##### LeSS rule about product definition
##### 关于产品定义的LeSS规则

The [LeSS rule about product definition](https://less.works/less/rules/index):
[关于产品定义的LeSS规则](https://less.works/less/rules/index):

> The definition of product should be as broad and end-user/customer centric as is practical. Over time, the definition of product might expand. Broader definitions are preferred.
> 产品的定义应该是在实际可行的前提下尽量宽泛并且以终端用户／客户为中心。随着时间的推移，产品的定义可能会扩大。我们倾向于更宽泛的定义。

Let’s break down this rule and reflect on the (two) product definitions of Y Soft.
让我们来拆解这个规则，并对Y Soft的（两个）产品定义进行反思。

* **‘As broad [...] as is practical’**<br/>From a whole product focus perspective, Y Soft could benefit from a [broad product definition](https://less.works/less/framework/product) for the following benefits:
* **‘在实际可行的前提下尽量宽泛’**</br>从整体产品焦点的角度来看，Y Soft可以从[宽泛的产品定义](https://less.works/less/framework/product)中获得以下好处：
    * **Adaptiveness for teams to shift from one topic to the other, depending on demand from customers and opportunities in the market**<br/>The optimization goal of LeSS is to be able to adapt to changing needs to be able to work on the highest customer value. When teams are locked into a narrower defined product, they are less likely to be able to adapt to work outside of the product definition, since the whole product view, understanding of the customer and market and the knowledge of the product are limited to the narrower definition of the product. With a single product, teams will have a broader view of the product, a broader understanding of the customer and market and it gets easier for them to adapt to other types of work. Of course, this still involves learning, but it’s easier from a whole product view compared to a narrower product view.
    * **团队根据客户需求和市场机会从一个主题转向另一个主题的适应性**<br/>LeSS的优化目标是能适应不断变化的需求，以能实现最高的客户价值。当团队被限制在一个狭窄定义的产品中时，他们不太可能适应其产品定义之外的工作，因为整个产品视图、对客户和市场的理解以及产品知识都局限在狭窄定义的产品中。如果是一个产品，团队将有更广阔的视野、对客户和市场更广泛的了解，从而也更容易适应其它类型的工作。当然，这仍然需要学习，但与狭窄的产品视角相比，以整个产品视角会更容易。
    * **Working on highest value from global level**<br/>Having two products will at some point in time cause that for product 1 the value is significantly higher than for product 2. But the teams working on product 2 will still pick up the highest value for product 2, instead of picking up a higher value item for product 1. Which means from a customer and organization perspective less potential value that is picked up.
    * **工作在全局最高的价值上**<br/>定义成两个产品会在某个时间点导致产品1的价值明显高于产品2。但是，工作在产品2上的团队仍然会挑选产品2的最高价值来做，而不是挑选产品1中更高价值的条目。这意味着从客户和组织的角度来看，我们挑选了潜在价值较少的工作。
    * **Better overview and finer-grained prioritization**<br/>With the choice to move to two products, there is less overview on company level, because the two products have separate Product Backlogs and less alignment between them. Having two products limits the overview, while e.g. OMNI Series is relatively small with just 3 teams working on it back then.
    * **更好的总览和更细粒度的优先级**<br/>选择转向两个产品，公司层面的总览会减少，因为这两个产品有单独的产品待办列表，它们之间也更少对齐。分成两个产品限制了总览，同时例如OMNI系列相对较小，当时只有3个团队在它上面工作。
    * **Avoid duplication between similar products**<br/>Like explained before, Y Soft considers the products as different and expects little duplication between them. There is certainly duplication amongst the products, because the products need to be connected and use the same infrastructural technologies. The consideration is how much duplication there is and whether this justifies a move to two products. Good design can also limit duplication amongst the products, especially when considered as a single product.
    * **避免类似产品之间的重复**<br/>如前所述，Y Soft认为这两个产品是不同的，并预期它们之间几乎没有重复。明显两个产品之间是存在重复的，因为产品需要连接并使用相同的基础设施技术。要考虑的是有多少重复，以及它能否充分支持转向两个产品的选择。良好的设计也能限制产品之间的重复，尤其是作为单个产品来考虑时。
    * **Consistency in user experience across all products**<br/>With more products it becomes harder to get consistency in user experience, because there is more alignment needed.
    * **所有产品的用户体验一致性**<br/>随着产品的增多，用户体验的一致性会变得更加困难，因为需要更多的对齐。
    * **Simplifies organizational complexity**<br/>Splitting the products meant that teams working for one product would have different ways of collaborating than teams working for the other product, e.g. dealing with self-management (e.g. hiring) and technical practices. This would eventually lead to a divergence of organizing and collaborating between the products, and therefore a more complex organizational environment. Having one product would lead to *less organizational complexity* compared to having two products. With the introduction of OMNI Series as a separate product, the additional processes, agreements (amongst teams) and more are complicating the organization. The consideration to take into account is how much this extra complexity is, as the organization is still relatively small.<br/><br/>From [Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710): ‘With a broad product definition all items are in the same backlog, thereby enabling fine-grained prioritization and increasing the overview in development and product.’<br/>With two products, there is less adaptiveness between the two products; e.g. when deciding to focus more to one over the other from the Product Backlog perspective. An explicit split into two products creates separate focus, less combined product decisions in development and product visions are likely to diverge over time. When taking into consideration that over time you want to broaden your product definition, a move to two products moves away from this broadening.<br/><br/>Let’s look at the ‘practical’ part from a broad product perspective, taking into account: '[...] can cause the initial product definition to be less than perfect. This opens the door for using the product definition as a tool for continuous improvement.' ([Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710)). Interestingly, the three teams working on OMNI Series basically already focused on OMNI Series before the move to two products, aside from doing ‘mandatory work’ (handling support as the fast-response team and release duty) that was mainly related to SAFEQ. While the teams encountered mainly practical problems for SAFEQ, the incorporation of OMNI Series wasn’t considered ‘impractical’ from teams’ perspective.
    * **简化组织复杂性**<br/>拆成不同产品意味着为一个产品工作的团队与为另一个产品工作的团队会有不同的协作方式，比如处理自我管理（如招聘）和技术实践。这最终会导致产品之间在组织和协作上出现分化，从而形成更复杂的组织环境。与拆成两个产品相比，作为一个产品将*减少组织复杂性*。随着引入OMNI系列作为一个单独的产品，额外的流程、约定（团队之间）等使组织复杂化。需要考虑的是这种额外的复杂性有多大，因为组织仍然相对较小。<br/><br/>来自[《大规模Scrum：以少为多》](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710)：“通过宽泛的产品定义，所有条目都在同一个待办列表中，从而可以进行细粒度的优先级排序，并增加开发和产品的总览。”<br/>当有两个产品时，两个产品之间的适应性会变差；例如，当从产品待办列表的角度决定更多聚焦一个而不是另一个时。明确拆成两个产品会产生不同的焦点，开发中较少一起考虑的产品决策和产品愿景可能会随着时间的推移而分化。当考虑到随着时间的推移你想要扩大产品定义，转向两个产品就背离了这种扩大。<br/><br/>让我们从一个宽泛产品的角度来看‘实际可行’的部分，考虑到：“[…]可能会导致最初的产品定义不够完美。这使得用产品定义作为持续改进的工具成为可能”（[《大规模Scrum：以少为多》](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710))。有趣的是，工作在OMNI系列上的三个团队在转向两个产品之前基本上就已经聚焦在OMNI系列上了，除了做“必须的工作”（主要与SAFEQ相关，作为快速响应团队处理支持工作以及发布的职责）之外。虽然团队主要遇到在SAFEQ上的实际可行的问题，但从团队的角度来看，加入OMNI系列并不被认为是“不切实际的”。
* **‘As [...] end-user/customer centric as is practical’**<br/>Both OMNI Series and SAFEQ are end-user/customer centric, they are recognized and understood by customers and end-users, and delivery can happen for both directly to customers. From this perspective, it’s practical to have two products. However, the question is whether it would be impractical to keep both as one product. Obviously, the sales channels (B2B vs B2C) are different as well as the market segments OMNI Series and SAFEQ focus on. However, does this validate the decision to move to two products from an end-user/customer perspective? Having a single (internal) product doesn’t mean that there can’t be different variations of the product sold with different names and identity. It doesn’t affect customers or end-users having a single product, as long as you organize the customer-centricity well and incorporate customer feedback into the Product Backlog. This would be an external narrow (e.g. different marketed products) versus an internal broad product, which gives you the whole product view, ability to adapt but still be able to distinguish to different customer types or markets. When the optimization goal is to have *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight*, a broader product definition is consistent.<br/><br/>If we look at duplicate product/business functionality, customers don’t need something completely different than printing & scanning solutions, even though the offerings from the two products are for a different segment of the market. However, from a duplicate functionality perspective, several things could happen (from Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS). There is porting of the functionality needed from SAFEQ to OMNI Series, which requires additional coordination and code clarification, especially over time when the teams haven’t worked closely together for a longer time. Second, there is the infrastructure that is shared and organizationally included in one team outside the two products, which has introduced some associated organizational complexity mainly in the additional coordination needed.<br/><br/>Let’s look at the commonalities that restrain the product definition (from [Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710)) for *adaptiveness towards highest customer value*: 1) vision, 2) customers or markets and 3) domain. If we look at 1) the vision, from the internal Y Soft perspective the visions are considered different between SAFEQ and OMNI Series. However, they are both there - very high level - to help customers with their printing & scanning solutions. For 2) the customers or markets, there are different segments of the market that are focused on. However, the customers still want solutions for similar problems. And this brings us to 3) domain. Both products are still around printing & scanning solutions, not something completely different.<br/><br/>If we look into the ‘practical’ part of the customer/end-user, we can argue that it would also be practical when having one product. Sales & Marketing kept working the same way in the same structure, independently from having one or two products. That would mean that it would not be impractical from a sales & marketing perspective.<br/><br/>Right now, some parts of the product are not included in the product definition, e.g. the hardware development (for both products) and the installation and support of the product for customers (for SAFEQ). From a customer/end-user perspective, the other parts could be included in the product definition in the future, when the organization learns and improves and ‘practical might evolve over time’.
* **‘在实际可行的前提下尽量以终端用户／客户为中心’**<br/>OMNI系列和SAFEQ都是以最终用户和客户为中心的，它们被客户和最终用户所认识和理解，并且可以直接向客户交付。从这个角度来看，拆成两个产品是实际可行的。然而，问题是将两者作为一个产品是否不切实际。显然，销售渠道（B2B与B2C）以及OMNI系列和SAFEQ所聚焦的细分市场是不同的。然而，这是否从最终用户/客户的角度验证了转向两个产品的决定？作为一个（内部）产品并不意味着不能有不同型号的产品以不同名称和商标进行销售。作为一个产品不会影响客户或最终用户，只要你能组织好客户中心，并将客户反馈纳入产品待办列表中。这将是一个从外部看狭窄的（比如营销成不同的产品）与从内部看宽泛的产品，它既给你提供了整个产品视图和适应能力，又仍然能够区分不同的客户类型或市场。当优化目标是*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*时，更宽泛的产品定义是与其一致的。<br/><br/>如果我们考虑重复的产品/业务功能，客户并不需要与打印和扫描解决方案完全不同的东西，即使两个产品针对不同的细分市场。然而，从重复功能的角度来看，有几件事情可能会发生（来自[《大规模Scrum：以少为多》](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710)）。需要从SAFEQ移植功能到OMNI系列，这要额外的协调和代码澄清，尤其是在团队长期没有密切协作的情况下。其次，两个产品有共享的基础设施，它在组织上属于两个产品之外的一个团队。这引入了一些相关的组织复杂性，主要在于所需的额外协调。<br/><br/>让我们看看限制产品定义*取得最高客户价值的适应性*的共同特征（来自[《大规模Scrum：以少为多》](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710))：1）愿景，2）客户或市场，3）领域。如果我们从1）愿景来看，Y Soft内部认为SAFEQ和OMNI系列的愿景是不同的。然而，从很高层次看他们都是帮助客户提供打印和扫描解决方案。对于2）客户或市场，两者确实聚焦不同的细分市场。然而，客户想要的仍然是解决类似问题的方案。这就把我们带到了3）领域。这两个产品仍然围绕着打印和扫描解决方案，并不是完全不同的东西。<br/><br/>如果深入来看客户/最终用户‘实际可行’的部分，我们可以说作为一个产品也是可行的。销售和市场部在相同的组织结构下延续了之前的工作方式，与一个还是两个产品并不相关。这意味着从销售和市场的角度来看并非不切实际。<br/><br/>目前，产品的某些部分并没包括在产品定义中，比如硬件开发（两个产品）以及提供给客户的产品安装和支持（SAFEQ）。从客户/最终用户的角度来看，当组织通过学习改进使得‘实际可行’逐渐发生变化时，在未来其它部分就可以包括在产品定义中。
* **‘Over time, definition of product might expand’**<br/> One of the reasons to move to two products was a weak product vision. The first LeSS book ([Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710)) explains impracticalities of a broad product definition: ‘it becomes increasingly hard to express a clear and compelling product vision.’ However, the root cause of the weak product vision was NOT the broadness of the product definition.<br/><br/>One might expand the definition of product in the future, because of the desire to continuously improve towards perfection, e.g. by ‘extending done’ and adding ‘undone’ work to the product definition. Since the start of the LeSS journey, Y Soft has done this in the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption (combining people to create cross-functional teams) and after (e.g. adding architects and on-premise infrastructure to the teams) to improve. However, by choosing to move to two products, the definition of product decreases.<br/><br/>By choosing the split into two products, basically Y Soft restrains the product definition instead of expanding it. Which is less consistent with *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight*. But perhaps it is valuable for other optimization goals.
* **‘随着时间的推移，产品的定义可能会扩大’**<br/>转向两个产品的原因之一是薄弱的产品愿景。LeSS的第一本书（[《大规模Scrum：以少为多》](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321985710))解释了宽泛产品定义的不切实际之处：‘越来越难以表达清晰且吸引的产品愿景’。然而，产品愿景薄弱的根本原因并不是产品定义的宽泛。<br/><br/>我们可能会在未来扩展产品的定义，因为希望不断改进以达到完美，比如通过‘扩展完成’并把‘完成外’的工作加入到产品定义中。自从开启LeSS的旅程，Y Soft已经在为期4天启动LeSS导入的活动中做到了这一点（将人员组合起来创建跨职能团队），并在之后进行改进（比如把架构师和私有基础设施加到团队）。然而，由于转向两个产品，产品的定义却缩小了。<br/><br/>通过选择拆成两个产品，Y Soft基本上是限制了产品定义，而不是扩展它；这与*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*的优化目标不太一致。当然它可能对其它优化目标是有价值的。
* **‘Broader definitions are preferred’**<br/>In the previous bullet, we discussed the decrease of the product definition by choosing to move to two products. In the discussion before deciding to move to two products, there was explicitly discussed that there is a risk that this leads to a ‘multi-product’ strategy, where innovation happens outside the product and outside the teams. In the long term, Y Soft risks ending up with several products which 1) from a broad product definition should be one (or at least less) product(s) and 2) are developed outside teams without using the integration and knowledge from your existing products well. Senior management acknowledged this risk, but mentioned that they wouldn’t let this happen and was not the direction to follow.
* **‘倾向于更宽泛的定义’**<br/>在前一点中，我们讨论了由于选择转向两个产品而带来的产品定义缩小。在决定转向两个产品之前的讨论中，明确讨论到了有导致‘多产品’战略的风险，即创新发生在产品之外和团队之外。从长远来看，Y Soft有风险最终会产生几个产品，1）从宽泛的产品定义来看应该是一个（或至少是更少个数的）产品，2）是在没有充分利用现有产品的集成和知识的情况下在团队之外开发的。高管承认这一风险，但提到他们不会让这种情况发生，也不是应该发展的方向。

##### Getting feedback from customers
##### 从客户那里获得反馈

One thing that wasn’t taken into account in the discussion to move to two products was learning (empiricism) on the development of OMNI Series. At the time of deciding to move to two products, OMNI Series wasn’t launched yet or tested by actual customers. First, it was unknown whether OMNI Series would be selling well or would be sold in small amounts, which would not justify a separate product yet (*note: by the time of writing this, OMNI Series had sold well*). Second, there was no feedback incorporated from actual customers, which might change the priorities and direction of OMNI Series or would validate the ideas and proposition that was done. If the direction would be persevered, different reasoning and discussions on the product definition could have happened, which might have led to another decision.

有一件事在讨论转向两个产品时没有被考虑在内，那就是基于OMNI系列开发的学习（来自实际的验证）。在决定转向两个产品时，OMNI系列还没有推出，也没有经过实际客户的测试。首先，尚不清楚OMNI系列会卖得好还是只有少量，因此还不能证明作为一个独立产品的合理性（*注：在撰写本文时，OMNI系列已经卖得很好*）。其次，还没有实际客户的反馈，它可能会改变OMNI系列的优先级和方向，或者验证所做的想法和主张。如果坚持这个方向，可能会发生产品定义上的不同推理和讨论，由此可能会产生另一个决定。

##### Creating a simpler organization
##### 创建一个更简洁的组织

One of the reasons to have a broader product definition is to create a simpler organization. Two Product Backlogs, two Product Owners, more (still parallel) Sprints, usually more managers (with extra alignment as a consequence) and other things lead to more complexity in the organization, by e.g. extra coordination across products for the common parts. In a system the interaction effects are the major influence, so reducing the interaction effects helps in making the system better. This is the opposite of a simpler organization and a local optimization with negative consequences, such as extra handoffs and complex coordination. However, for the teams there was not much change and the rest of the organization also didn’t adapt to the move to two products (except for having two Product Owners instead of one). In the short term, the move to two products probably doesn’t lead to a more complex organization, because basically there wasn’t too much change as a result of this decision. However, in the long term there will be added complexity due to the interaction effects. Vision and directions will diverge, extra coordination will be needed for common parts, and that rarely happens well, thus leading to lots more duplication and inconsistencies. Teams will be less familiar with each other's work and way of working, leading to additional coordination problems and less responsibility taken by teams.

更宽泛产品定义的原因之一是创建一个更简洁的组织。两个产品待办列表、两个产品负责人、更多（仍是并行的）迭代、通常更多的管理者（因此有额外的对齐）和其它事情导致组织更加复杂，比如跨产品就公共部件进行额外协调。在一个交互效应是主要影响因素的系统中，减少交互效应有助于使系统变得更好。拆成两个产品与更简洁的组织相反，是有负面后果的局部优化，比如额外的交接和复杂的协调。然而，对于团队来说没有太大的变化，组织的其它部分也没有为转向两个产品作出调整（除了有两个产品负责人而不是一个）。从短期来看，转向两个产品可能并没有导致一个更加复杂的组织，因为基本上没有因为这个决定而发生太多变化。然而，从长远来看，由于交互效应将会有增加的复杂性。愿景和方向会出现分化，共同部分需要额外的协调，而这很少顺畅，从而导致更多的重复和不一致。团队将对彼此的工作和工作方式越发不熟悉，导致额外的协调问题和团队承担的责任减少。

##### Collaboration
##### 协作

In LeSS, one of the crucial things is to collaborate (mainly between and within teams), and to encourage collaboration as much as possible, in contrast to the common refrain, “collaboration between developers is inefficient and difficult, so organize to avoid it.” The optimization goal of LeSS is *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight*. Collaboration - and as a corollary *learning* - between teams is essential to be able to move towards this optimization goal. Having two products leads to two (different) priorities and this limits collaboration between teams, and restricts the adaptiveness.

LeSS中一件至关重要的事情是协作（主要是在团队间和团队内），并鼓励尽可能多的协作，这与常见的说法“开发人员之间的协作效率低且困难，所以调整组织方式以避免它”形成了鲜明对比。LeSS的优化目标是*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*。团队之间的协作 - 以及必然相伴的学习 - 对于实现这一优化目标至关重要。两个产品导致两个（不同的）优先级，这限制了团队之间的协作，进而限制了适应性。

In many organizations, collaboration (and learning) is often seen as costly or inefficient. In order to learn - on a product level - collaboration is essential. For a complex product, teams need to collaborate, share and learn together and teach each other to be able to work on important features from a customer perspective. The thinking that collaboration is inefficient often comes from looking only at the surface and not the underlying system and structures. The forces that make collaboration costly or inefficient are usually a consequence of the structures in the organization that make collaboration inefficient and expensive. For example waiting for others (e.g. because teams are single specialized), having unsupportive technology in the product for collaboration or decision making outside the teams and product group, which are local optimizations.

在许多组织中，协作（和学习）往往被视为成本高昂或效率低下。为了在产品层面上学习，协作是必不可少的。对于一个复杂产品，团队需要协作、共享和共同学习，并相互教学，以便能够工作在从客户角度看重要的特性上。协作效率低下的想法往往来自于只看表面，而不看根本的系统和结构。使协作成本高或效率低的力量通常是组织中相应的结构造成的结果。比如等待他人（因为团队是单一专业化的），在产品中使用不支持协作的技术，或者在团队和产品组之外进行决策，这些都是局部优化。

##### One versus two products
##### 一个与两个产品

In previous sections, we concluded that there isn’t too much change - especially for teams - by moving to two products, at least in the short term. From that perspective, there aren’t too many disadvantages in the short term of having two products instead of one, and because the teams still knew each other very well, there was limited extra effort needed to align on features.

在前几节中，我们得出的结论是至少在短期内转向两个产品并没有太大的变化，尤其是对团队来说。从这个角度来看，拆成两个产品在短期内并没有太多缺点，而且由于团队仍然非常了解彼此，只需有限的额外努力就能在特性上保持一致。

For the optimization goal of *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight*, there are several reasons why moving to Requirement Areas instead of moving to two products is more contributing to *adaptiveness to discover highest customer value or delight*. The perceived customer value of the items for one product over the other will change over time, which will lead to one of the products working on lower (perceived) value for the customer and organization as a whole, because teams in one product will only work from the Product Backlog of that product. This will similarly happen to working from the highest (perceived) value from one Requirement Area over the other. However, when that happens, the Product Owner can decide to move team(s) to the other Requirement Area, being able to adapt relatively easily. Though there will always be some delay. Additionally, separating into two products likely comes with creating a separate product group, with a separate manager or managers and specialist positions accompanying the product. Changing the priority for one product over the other will be hard, because of these positions. While in a LeSS Huge the single Product Owner can simply choose to move teams from one Requirement Area over the other, because the Requirement Areas are not linked to the organizational structure with (a) manager(s) and other positions attached to it. This way, it is fairly easy to change direction on the whole product level compared to having two products. Additionally, when a customer request spans products and there are private code ownership boundaries per product, this will increase the lead time of a customer request that spans the products. Y Soft didn’t create a separate product group and kept the organization simple, as described in other sections.

对于*适应性提升以发现最高的客户价值或满意度*的优化目标，有几个原因可以解释为什么转向需求领域而不是转向两个产品会更有利。一个产品的条目被感知的客户价值相对于另一个产品的将随时间推移而变化，这将导致其中一个产品对客户和组织作为整体来说产生的价值较低，因为一个产品的团队只会根据这个产品的产品待办列表来工作。这同样会发生在一个需求领域的最高价值工作不及另一个需求区域的工作。然而，当这种情况发生时，产品负责人可以决定将团队转向另一个需求领域，调整起来相对容易。尽管总会有一些延迟。此外，拆成两个产品可能会伴随着创建各自的产品组，与产品关联的各自经理和专家职位。由于这些位置的存在，改变一个产品相对于另一个产品的优先级将很难。而在LeSS巨型中，唯一的产品负责人可以简单地选择将团队从一个需求领域转到另一个，因为需求领域没有与设置了经理和其他职位的组织结构相关联。这样一来，在整个产品层面上改变方向相比两个产品会容易许多。此外，当一个客户请求跨多个产品，并且每个产品都有私有代码所有权的边界时，这将增加跨产品客户请求的交付周期时间。Y Soft并没有创建各自的产品组，而是保持了组织的简洁，如其它部分所述。

##### Alternative options
##### 其它选项

Instead of moving to two products, there are other options for the problems that were perceived.
对于所感知到的问题，除了转向两个产品之外存在其它选项。

One of these options is doing what teams were already doing: teams focusing on specific domains. Three teams working on the single Product Backlog focused in PBR and in their Sprints on the PBI’s related to OMNI Series. This would have still given focus on OMNI Series, but without losing the adaptability to switch to and then focus on different parts of the product at other moments and collaborate across teams when needed, increasing adaptiveness. With the co-founder becoming Product Owner for SAFEQ (see [this section](#324-change-of-product-owners)), there was more clarity on the vision and priorities, and teams were able to focus more on certain (customer) domains based on the vision and priorities. If this would have happened before the discussion and decision to move to two products, the decision might have been different because this problem would have been solved most likely.

其中一个选项是做团队已经在做的事情：团队聚焦在特定领域上。工作在唯一产品待办列表上的其中三个团队在PBR和他们的迭代中重点关注与OMNI系列相关的条目。这样做仍然给予了OMNI系列聚焦，但没有失去在其它时刻切换并专注于产品不同部分的适应性，并在需要时跨团队协作以提高适应性。随着联合创始人成为SAFEQ的产品负责人（见[本节](#324-change-of-product-owners)），愿景和优先级更加清晰，团队能够根据愿景和优先级更多聚焦在某些（客户）领域。如果这发生在讨论和决定转向两个产品之前，决定可能会有所不同，因为这个问题很可能已经得到解决。

Another option would have been to move OMNI Series work to one Requirement Area. The Requirement Areas for Y Soft have to be explored and defined further. When the product vision and focus - especially from a Product Owner perspective - are valid problems to solve, this option would have given the chance to create a better product vision and involve more customer feedback into that. With Requirement Areas for a single Product Backlog, still one Product Owner could decide on the priorities - including those for OMNI Series - and decide to focus on something else than OMNI Series or focus more on OMNI Series when OMNI Series would be selling really well and the customer demand would be big. This would still give the adaptiveness to set priorities, and teams would have more options to collaborate and learn from each other. Furthermore, in LeSS Huge with Requirement Areas, it is easily adaptive for teams to slowly move from one area to another (while being aware of the cognitive overload issues), in response to discovery, but on the other hand with two products it is at the very least ‘politically’ difficult to move teams between two product groups.

另一个选项是将OMNI系列工作转到一个需求领域。Y Soft的需求领域需要进一步探索和定义。当产品愿景和焦点 - 尤其是从产品负责人的角度来看 - 是需要解决的有效问题时，这一选项将有机会创建更好的产品愿景，并让更多客户反馈融入其中。作为唯一产品待办列表中的需求领域，仍然会有一个产品负责人能够决定优先级，包括OMNI系列的工作；他能够决定聚焦OMNI系列以外的其它内容，或者在OMNI系列销售非常好且客户需求很大时更多地聚焦OMNI系列。这仍将赋予设定优先级的适应性，团队也将有更多选项来协作和相互学习。此外，在有需求领域的LeSS巨型中，团队为了响应发现成果从一个领域慢慢转到另一个领域是容易适应的（虽然意识到认知过载的问题），但另一方面有两个产品的情况下，在两个产品组之间移团队至少在‘政治’上也是困难的。

#### 3.2.3 Reflection on coaching and consulting
#### 3.2.3 针对辅导和咨询的反思

From the agile coaches perspective, the reflection that has been described here wasn’t included in the discussion with the CEO, the strategist and the VP of all products to move to two products. Some of these insights were taken into account and were clear at the time of the discussion, but many of these insights were learned in hindsight. As a consequence, in the discussion with senior management, the external consultant and the agile coaches failed to give a good explanation of the organizational consequences for choosing either for two products or one product with Requirement Areas. The discussion moved towards *semantics* whether the two products are actually two products or not, while the discussion should have been about the (organizational) consequences for choosing for separate products or Requirement Areas within a product. With these insights in mind, the discussion to move to two products would have been different and the outcome might have been different as well. That’s why I feel it’s important to share our learnings in this case study, to help others in similar situations.

从敏捷教练的角度来看，这里描述的反思在与CEO、战略规划师和所有产品VP讨论转向两个产品时并没有包括。其中一些见解在讨论当时考虑到了而且也很清楚，但许多见解是事后才学到的。因此，外部顾问和敏捷教练在与高管的讨论中就选择两个产品还是一个产品多个需求领域未能很好地解释它们的组织后果。讨论转向了*语义*，即它们实际上是否是两个产品；而讨论应该就选择独立的两个产品还是一个产品中的需求领域所会产生的（组织）后果展开。具备这些见解，转向两个产品的讨论会有所不同，结果也可能不同。这就是为什么我觉得在这个案例研究中分享我们的经验很重要，以帮助处于类似情况的其他人。

#### 3.2.4 Change of Product Owner(s)
#### 3.2.4 产品负责人的更换

With the change to two products, the CEO decided to change the Product Owner. The previous Product Owner for the - at that time still - one product was one person from the product marketing department, while his colleagues from the product marketing department helped teams in Product Backlog Refinement and other activities. The new focus on two separate products made the CEO decide to choose a Product Owner from the board of directors, for each product. The new Product Owners are better able to make (strategic) decisions about the product, because they have more mandate and discuss the strategy within the Y Soft board.  The previous Product Owner was still involved as one of the members from product marketing.

伴随变成两个产品，CEO决定更换产品负责人。之前的产品负责人 - 当时仍然是一个产品 - 是产品市场部门的一个人，而他们部门的同事则会帮助团队进行产品待办列表梳理和其它活动。对两个独立产品的新关注使CEO决定从董事会中为每个产品选择一名产品负责人。新的产品负责人都能更好地对产品做出（战略）决策，因为他们有更多的授权，并在Y Soft董事会内讨论战略。前产品负责人仍然作为产品市场的成员之一参与其中。

Though the Product Owner from the product marketing team had a mandate to work with teams and make decisions on priorities, it was hard for him to make strategic decisions and to access the strategic thinking from senior management. Because of this, from time to time, direction had to be changed. The new Product Owners are actively involved in discussions about the products and the strategic minds behind it as members of the board, which makes decision making easier and setting and sharing direction as well. In addition to having the co-founder as Product Owner, an experienced and well-appreciated colleague from elsewhere in the organization joined as a *supporting* PO (LeSS experiment), not making the priority decisions, but helping the Product Owner and the teams.

尽管来自产品市场团队的产品负责人有被授权与团队工作并进行优先级决策，但他很难做战略决策，也很难接触到高管的战略思维。正因为如此，产品方向不得不经常改变。新产品负责人作为董事会成员积极参与有关产品及其背后战略思想的讨论，这使得决策及设定和分享产品方向更为容易。除了让联合创始人担任产品负责人外，还有一位来自组织其它地方经验丰富且备受赞赏的同事作为*助理*PO（LeSS实验）加入，他不做优先级决策，但会帮助产品负责人和团队。

#### 3.2.5 What happened?
#### 3.2.5 发生了什么？

The senior management decided to split the Product Backlog and have less teams working on a part of the Product Backlog. Their reasoning was to be able to deal with the inability of the Product Owner to have and share a good product vision and understanding of the customer and market needs. Senior management (the CEO, the strategist, the VP of all products) wanted to split the Product Backlog by moving to LeSS Huge initially, but in the end decided to split into two products because of the emerging development of OMNI Series during that period. The assumption from senior management was that with a split, the PO - and supporting product marketing people - had a better overview, better understanding of the Product Backlog and better understanding of customer and market needs. Teams would have more focus on a (customer) domain, because there would be a smaller (part of the) Product Backlog to focus on and less teams working on that smaller (part of the) Product Backlog.

高管决定拆分产品待办列表，让更少团队工作于其中一部分产品待办列表。他们的理由是以此能解决产品负责人无法拥有和分享好的产品愿景以及对客户和市场需求的理解这一问题。高管（CEO、战略规划师、所有产品VP）最初是想通过转向LeSS巨型来拆分产品待办列表，但因为在此期间OMNI系列的新兴发展他们最终决定了拆成两个产品。高管的假设是通过拆分，PO和支持产PO的产品市场人员会有一个更好的总览，可以更好地了解产品待办列表，更好地了解客户和市场需求。团队将在一个（客户）领域上更多聚焦，因为需要关注的（部分）产品待办列表变小了，并且更少团队工作于那个较小的（部分）产品待办列表。

Thus, there was a move to two products, with a single Product Owner for each (both board members) and a single Product Backlog for each. The teams already working on OMNI Series moved to work on the Product Backlog for OMNI Series (3 teams), and the other teams moved to work on the Product Backlog for SAFEQ (10 teams). The first Sprint for the new products started in November 2020.

因此就转向了两个产品，每个产品都有一个产品负责人（都是董事会成员），每个产品都有一份产品待办列表。已经在OMNI系列上工作的团队转向工作于OMNI系列的产品待办列表（3个团队），其他团队转向工作于SAFEQ的产品待办列表（10个团队）。新拆分产品的第一个迭代在2020年11月开始。

### 3.3 Inspect
### 3.3 检视

#### 3.3.1 Inspection on the weak product vision
#### 3.3.1 针对薄弱产品愿景的检视

The whole organization focused on the strategic changes and all the important people of the company were available to help, which meant increasing participation of people in Product Backlog Refinement & Sprint Review. There was not a good alignment between the strategy, the product vision or roadmap and the Product Backlog. Requirements and priorities changed often and the Product Owner and supporting product marketing people couldn’t keep up with the pace that the CEO and VP of Marketing expected, which led to a weak product vision and a lack of understanding from teams on the product vision. It led to ‘just do’ what the Product Owner was told and therefore also for teams harder to understand the direction and to challenge the customer and market needs. Because actual customers were involved too late in the development, the feedback was entirely only from within the organization for a long time. Different stakeholders had different ideas and needs about the work to be done (e.g. support vs sales). This also delayed the creation of the roadmap.

整个组织都关注战略改变，公司的所有重要人员都可以提供帮助，这意味着更多地参与产品待办列表梳理和迭代评审。战略、产品愿景或路线图与产品待办列表之间没有很好的对齐。需求和优先级经常发生变化，产品负责人和支持他的产品市场人员无法跟上CEO和市场VP期望的节奏，这导致产品愿景薄弱、团队对产品愿景缺乏理解。这导致了‘只是做’产品负责人被告知的事情，因此也让团队更难理解方向，更难挑战客户和市场需求。由于实际客户参与开发的时间太晚，所以在很长一段时间内反馈完全只来自组织内部。不同的干系人对要做的工作有不同的想法和需要（比如支持与销售）。这也推迟了路线图的制定。

#### 3.3.2 Inspection on the cognitive overload
#### 3.3.2 针对认知过载的检视

The root causes of the frequent change of focus that teams experienced was the weak product vision and too often changing priorities on the short term, so teams felt a lack of focus. It was cognitive overload for the teams, needing to learn too many different things in too short a time, which they felt as a lack of focus. couldn’t focus on a specific (customer) domain for a period of time. Senior management did identify the too often changing priorities, but didn’t link this as the root cause for the cognitive overload. If this was addressed, teams could have been helped to have e.g. focus on a specific (customer) domain for a period of time, and focus on learning in that area. Or extra attention on the customer domain and/or architecture, by e.g. having domain workshops or architecture workshops. Attempts from the agile coaches to help the Product Owner to have more consistency on sharing for the long term failed, which didn’t help teams in their cognitive overload.

团队频繁改变焦点的根本原因是产品愿景薄弱，而且短期内过于频繁地改变优先级，以至于团队感到缺乏聚焦。这对团队来说是认知过载，需要在太短的时间内学习太多不同的东西，他们觉得这是缺乏聚焦，无法在一段时间内专注于特定的（客户）领域。高管确实注意到了经常变化的优先级，但没有将它跟认知过载的根本原因关联起来。如果解决了这一问题，可以帮助团队在一段时间内聚焦在特定（客户）领域，并专注于该领域的学习。或者通过举办领域研讨会或架构研讨会等方式来对客户领域和/或架构给予额外关注。敏捷教练在帮助产品负责人更一致地分享长期愿景这方面的尝试失败了，也没能帮助到团队减轻认知过载。

Once the co-founder became the PO, there was a consistent product vision, with clear priorities and a good collaboration between the PO and the teams. This improved the (feeling of) focus for teams and reduced the cognitive overload. There was more satisfaction from internal stakeholders and external customers. Teams had a better baseline to improve further and knew better where to focus on and what to learn for the long-term. This proved that the cognitive overload for teams wasn’t caused by the broadness of the product, and the root cause was removed by having a Product Owner with a strong product vision and more consistent priority decisions.

当联合创始人成为PO时，就有了一致的产品愿景，也有了明确的优先级，以及PO和团队之间的良好合作。这提升了团队的聚焦（感受），并减少了认知过载。内部干系人和外部客户的满意度更高了。团队有一个更好的基线来进一步改进，并且更清楚在哪里聚焦以及长期该学习什么。这证明了团队的认知过载并不是由于产品的宽泛造成的，一位具有强大产品愿景和更一致优先级决策的产品负责人可以消除其根本原因。

#### 3.3.3 Inspection on the products having different customers, markets and sales channels
#### 3.3.3 针对产品具有不同客户、市场和销售渠道的检视

First, if you use a broad product definition, would the customers & markets be so different? There would still be customers that require solutions for their printing & scanning, though these are in a different segment of the market. Customers buying OMNI Series wouldn’t need something completely different than printing & scanning solutions. From an outside perspective, these products are very similar when you zoom out, though can be perceived very differently from an inside perspective. Second, the sales channels are different. But is this a sufficient reason to split the product? OMNI Series would require selling directly to customers, creating a webshop, and having different promotion approaches. But can’t there be different sales strategies within one product? There are many broad product definitions where the product is sold to different types of customers and the use of different sales channels. Office365 might be an example where there is broad internal product thinking, while there are different sales channels, customer types and even parts of Office365 sold separately.

首先，如果你用一个宽泛的产品定义，客户和市场会因此很不同吗？仍然是有客户想要打印和扫描解决方案，尽管这些客户会在不同的细分市场。购买OMNI系列的客户并不需要与打印和扫描解决方案完全不同的东西。当你从外部视角拉远来看，这些产品都非常相似，尽管从内部视角来看可以很不同。第二，销售渠道是不同的。但这是否是拆分产品的充分理由？OMNI系列将要求直接向客户销售，创建网店，并采用不同的促销方法。但是在一个产品中就不能有不同的销售策略吗？存在许多宽泛的产品定义，其中产品销售给不同类型的客户和使用不同的销售渠道。Office365可能就是一个例子 - 内部基于宽泛产品来思考，同时又有不同的销售渠道、客户类型，甚至部分产品是单独销售的。

Product development was split into two products, but marketing and sales kept working in the same structure as before, as one department for both products. From product marketing some people focused on OMNI Series, but worked still in the same product marketing group. This is a contradiction to the argument that marketing & sales are very different for the two products. Product development changes the structure based on this argument, while marketing & sales keep the same structure. Apparently the differences to marketing & sales were not so big outside product development (e.g. marketing and sales), so why would it justify a split for product development?

产品开发被拆成两个产品，但市场和销售仍保持着与以前相同的结构，作为一个部门兼顾两个产品。从产品市场来看，一些人专注于OMNI系列，但他们仍在同一个产品市场部门工作。这与两个产品的市场和销售非常不同的说法相矛盾。产品开发基于这一说法改变了结构，而市场和销售则保持了同样的结构。在产品开发之外（比如市场和销售）的差异显然并不大，那么它为什么能支撑对产品开发进行拆分？

#### 3.3.4 Inspection on adaptiveness
#### 3.3.4 针对适应性的检视

The change of strategy led to a big change in the priorities of the Product Backlog and teams needing to learn many new technologies, but also a different approach to customers. At least three of the teams fully focused on cloud technologies from the start and developed the infrastructure, configured it, changed many customer centric functionalities, addressed security etc. And they delivered a working environment with a large part of the customer centric features in the cloud within six months. This is an existence proof that having cross-functional teams and focusing on learning really works! These teams were able to discover and understand what was needed, learned new technologies and successfully developed the product with these new technologies, while a very limited amount of the prerequisites were set up before they started working on it. People from mostly IT worked closely with the teams to set up the infrastructure and to share some experiments they did in advance with cloud technologies. We can’t imagine this would have worked with adding new teams separately without the customer and product context, which happens often in *project*-based organizations. Before these occurrences in COVID-times, Y Soft’s senior management still considered LeSS (and Scrum) as ways to improve their delivery, quality and keeping agreements with customers about delivery. The changes in strategy and changed desires from customers made the senior management realize that the LeSS organizational changes and the ability of teams to deliver customer features end-to-end enabled them to change this quickly. In short, they got the benefits of an *adaptive* (agile) organization.

战略变化导致产品待办列表的优先级发生了重大变化，团队需要学习许多新技术，还需要对客户采取不同的方法。至少那三个团队从一开始就完全聚焦在云技术上，开发并配置了基础设施，改变了许多面向客户的功能，解决了安全问题等。他们在六个月内交付了一个在云上能用的环境，包含了大部分面向客户的特性。这证明了组建跨职能团队并聚焦学习确实有效！这些团队能够探索并理解需要什么，学习新技术，并用这些新技术成功开发出产品；而在他们开始工作之前仅准备了非常有限的前提条件。主要是来自IT部门的人员与团队紧密工作建立了基础设施，并分享了他们提前做的云技术相关试验。我们无法想象另行组建没有客户和产品上下文的新团队会有效，而这在基于*项目*的组织中却经常发生。在新冠疫情发生之前，Y Soft的高管仍然认为LeSS（和Scrum）是提高交付、质量，并做到信守客户交付协议的方法。战略变化和客户想法的变化使高管意识到LeSS的组织变革和团队端到端交付客户特性的能力使他们能够迅速改变。简言之，他们获得了*适应的*（敏捷的）组织这一好处。

### 3.4 Adapt
### 3.4 适应

A summary of the main adaptations that happened in moving to two products:
以下总结了在转向两个产品过程中发生的主要调整：

* Two Product Backlogs with two Product Owners
* Board members with mandate becoming Product Owners

* 两份产品待办列表，两个产品负责人
* 充分授权的董事会成员成为产品负责人

This brought the following main results:
这带来了以下主要结果：

* Less adaptiveness for the whole product and more alignment and overhead needed between the products
* Improved product vision and direction
* Less cognitive overload for the teams

* 对于整个产品更少的适应性，在产品之间需要更多的对齐和开销
* 改善了产品愿景和方向
* 减少了团队的认知过载

Since the move to two products, many small improvements and changes have happened. Especially regarding working together between teams, focusing on longer-term vision, improving technical excellence, and learning more customer domains.

自从转向两个产品又发生了许多小的改进和变化。特别是关于团队之间一起工作，聚焦长期愿景，提升技术卓越，并学习更多客户领域。

Teams between both products started working together more, having multi-team Product Backlog Refinement often about cross-product topics and have in-Sprint collaboration about cross-product topics, which are indications that a single broader product definition in a LeSS Huge adoption with Requirement Areas would have been a more consistent alternative than two products. In one Overall Retrospective, some team members wanted to better understand the overlap between the products and counted 13 shared components when they modeled the architectures out, further suggesting one broad product. This led to conversations and later the PO with the CEO decided that they would merge the two products back to one, working from one Product Backlog again with the single PO from SAFEQ (the co-founder). This proved that the assumption that the two products needed almost no collaboration was unjustified. The main impact was that teams from SAFEQ had to learn and help in the support of OMNI Series, which was relatively unknown for them. Teams from OMNI Series were still familiar with most parts of SAFEQ, which made it easier for them to deal with this. Teams found ways to collaborate and ‘buddy’ other teams to make sure all teams were able to do support for OMNI Series and SAFEQ properly.

两个产品之间的团队开始更多地一起工作，经常就跨产品主题进行多团队产品待办列表梳理，并在迭代中就跨产品主题进行协作。这也表明了相比两个产品，以一个更宽泛的产品定义但包含多个需求领域作为LeSS巨型导入将会是更一致的选项。在一次整体回顾中，一些团队成员希望更好地了解产品之间的重叠部分，当把架构建模出来时他们数出了13个共享组件，进一步表明同属一个宽泛的产品。这引发了对话，后来PO与CEO决定将两个产品合并回一个产品，再次以一份产品待办列表工作，而来自SAFEQ的PO（联合创始人）则作为唯一的PO。这证明两个产品几乎不需要协作的假设并不成立。由此带来的主要影响是来自SAFEQ的团队必须学习并帮助支持OMNI系列，这对他们来说是相对未知的。来自OMNI系列的团队仍然熟悉SAFEQ的大部分内容，这使他们更容易应对。团队找到协作的方式，并与其他团队‘结对’以确保所有团队都能支持好OMNI系列和SAFEQ。

### Conclusion
### 结论

Y Soft experienced big benefits due to the LeSS adoption. Teams were better able to see and understand the whole product, and additionally able to deliver more (and more impactful) end-to-end customer centric features than before. After the start of the LeSS adoption, teams got more in direct touch with customers and vendors, because they were working on customer-centric features instead of component requirements. Like any organization making a big change, Y Soft had its struggles too. In the first year of the LeSS adoption, sharing the ‘pains’ like doing regression testing by all teams, rotating support duty between teams and more was not always appreciated by teams, and the amount of learning was big to get a whole product focus. The CEO said once that the biggest success of the LeSS adoption is that ‘we managed to add many people and are still able to deliver more and more’, while also working together at scale.

Y Soft由于导入LeSS获得了巨大的收益。团队能够更好地看到和理解整个产品，此外还能够交付比以前更多（且更有影响）的端到端客户导向的特性。在开始导入LeSS之后，团队与客户和供应商有了更多的直接联系，因为他们是开发客户导向的特性，而不是组件需求。像任何做出重大变革的组织一样，Y Soft也有自己的挣扎。在导入LeSS的第一年，团队并不总能理解分担‘痛苦’ - 比如所有团队都做回归测试，在团队之间轮换支持职责，以及更多 - 的做法；而且为了获得整体产品焦点进行的学习也是大量的。CEO曾表示导入LeSS的最大成功在于‘我们成功地增加了很多人，而且还能够交付越来越多’，同时也进行了大规模的协作。

With the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Y Soft changed its strategy. The priorities on the Product Backlog changed approximately 70% and teams needed to learn - faster than before - new technologies and understand new market needs as a result of the change of strategy. Teams were more easily able to adapt to work with these new technologies and market, because of the increased adaptive organization. The adaptiveness of the teams would never be this fast and effective in the previous structure of the component-oriented teams working on different backlogs for several projects and stakeholders. Obviously, other variables helped in the improvements in Y Soft as well, like deciding to work without managers.

随着2020年新冠疫情大流行，Y Soft改变了战略。产品待办列表的优先级改变了大约70%；战略变化的结果是团队需要比以前更快地学习新技术并了解新的市场需求。因为更高适应性的组织，团队更容易适应这些新技术和市场。在以前面向组件的团队结构中，团队工作于许多项目和干系人的不同产品待办列表，他们的适应性永远不会如此快速有效。当然还有其它变化帮助到Y Soft的改进，比如决定在没有经理的情况下工作。

The uniqueness of the Y Soft LeSS adoption is the *willingness* and courage to keep inspecting and adapting the organizational design. Not just *starting* a LeSS adoption and making small improvements, but considering and executing larger changes, as described in this case study.

Y Soft的LeSS导入的独特之处在于不断检视和调整组织设计的*意愿*和勇气。正如本案例研究中所述，它不是*开始*LeSS导入然后只是进行小的改进，而是考虑并执行更大的变革。

## Appendix A: Technical excellence learnings

Teams have improved technical excellence significantly, since the start of the LeSS adoption. Teams had to learn many parts of the product, because they became cross-component and cross-functional since the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption. Additionally, teams shared the responsibility of e.g. support duty, fixing bugs and releasing across the entire product. Most teams needed to learn about these topics for the product. Having all teams work on these topics, made cross-component problems transparent and teams addressed many of these problems when encountering them. Additionally, teams made efforts to improve the technology that made product development better or easier (e.g. improvement in the build pipeline). However, the Head of Product realized that they needed more improvements on technical excellence. This appendix describes some specific interventions on technical excellence, and includes a generic reflection on technical excellence improvements.

#### A.1 Improvement Kata on technical excellence

An external consultant organized and facilitated an initial Improvement Kata (based on [Mike Rother’s Toyota Kata](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KT4I5G5PHYZ8&keywords=toyota+kata&qid=1682164626&s=books&sprefix=toyota+kata%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C261&sr=1-1)) on technical excellence, as a starting point of monthly iterations. Each month, the people working on the improvements came together to discuss progress to the next target condition (following the kata) and define a new next target condition (and identify some experiments to go there). Additionally, there was hands-on support on pair & mob programming sessions to work on these experiments. Participants included a significant group of representatives from the teams.

The main goal of the initial workshop was to define and agree on the first steps towards improving the overall technical excellence within Y Soft. It started by defining the ‘Definition of Awesome’ for the overall direction of becoming a technical leader.

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/definition-of-awesome.png" alt="Definition of Awesome">
</figure>

Definition of Awesome:
* One-click pre-release is possible and stable: this also means that we have a stop & fix mindset with regard to broken builds.
* Continuous cloud delivery: we should be able to deliver to the cloud when we want to with a minimum effort related to this.
* Documented target cloud-ready architecture - this architectural documentation needs to be a living artifact which is owned by the people actually working on and with it.
* Use well-known and well documented agreed standards when we can: we make sure that our standards are well-known across the development community and we document our decision in a way that clarifies the reasoning behind them.

The teams had just done a technical excellence self-assessment, and some volunteers made an overview of the current technical health (and used the technical health assessment from the preparation to the 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption). They used this as the current condition for the Improvement Kata.

The group defined three next target conditions (topics that were the most blocking) that were logical and feasible next steps towards the challenge:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/next-target-conditions.png" alt="Next Target Conditions">
</figure>

For each of the next target conditions, the participants defined metrics to see the progress on the improvement for each next target condition.

**Stop & fix broken builds**:

* The time it takes for a broken build to be fixed.
* The time it takes to start fixing a broken build.
* Number of people solving broken builds.
* The number of builds in focus relative to the total number of builds.

**One-click pre-release**:

* Number of manual steps necessary to do a pre-release.
* Number of automated steps relative to the total number of steps.
* The time it takes to do a pre-release.
* The total cost of pre-release.
* Rate of failure of pre-releases.

**Documented target cloud-ready architecture**:

* Vote of confidence from all people using it.
* Number of architectural decisions.
* Number of open questions.
* Number of questions that don't need a new decision.
* Number of architectural violations in the codebase.

For these next target conditions, there were first experiments defined in the workshop:

* Set up the metrics for broken builds.
* Create a list of all steps necessary to do a pre-release.
* Survey on the discoverability of the current architectural documentation.

The participants were happy about the results and the results of the first workshop looked promising. However, the group did limited follow-up on this workshop and monthly iterations didn’t happen. We reflect on this in the [reflection on technical excellence section](#a3-general-reflection-on-technical-excellence-improvements).

### A.2 Remote architectural kata (cross-company)

Co-Learning (now: Simplification Officers) organized a remote Architectural Kata for three clients that are in a LeSS adoption. A kata in this context is practicing skills outside the domain of the real battle. Goal of this kata is to learn architectural techniques for developers to use in their daily work, e.g. during development and for Product Backlog Refinement. To increase learning, the participants (and the breakout groups) were mixed cross-company, to be able to share knowledge.

We asked the participants to read in advance, the following:

* What is a Kata? <https://archkatas.herokuapp.com/>
* C4 Modelling: <https://c4model.com/> (levels 1 to 3)
* Example Mapping: <https://cucumber.io/blog/bdd/example-mapping-introduction/>
* Architecture Patterns: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern>

With a use case (‘Room with a view’, a next generation hotel reservation and management system), groups - cross-company - formed themselves to work together throughout the day in breakout rooms. In each iteration, groups worked with specific techniques on the use case. At the end of the round, they gathered with one of the other groups, to share their outcomes and learnings. This way, throughout the day, groups not only worked closely together, but also learned from the other groups. Each group had its own space in Mural, so they could design & draw together.

In the first iteration, the groups could decide on their own how they would architecture or model the use case. Some groups used other techniques than the ones provided and other groups started using C4 modeling right away. In the second iteration, questions were addressed about C4 modeling. After that, each group got the assignment to work on level 1 to 3 of C4 modeling together. In the third and final round, each group started adding details to the work with Example Mapping, to move to clear and well-scoped items for the case study. Each group had a facilitator to help them move forward. An example of an important aspect that facilitators focused on was: ‘first draw, then talk’.

*Example of the results of one group*:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/c4-modeling-example.png" alt="C4 Modeling Example">
</figure>

Participants liked the learnings and at the end they identified experiments in their own context to use the learnings in their daily work.

### A.3 General reflection on technical excellence improvements

Technical excellence is an enabler of business agility. Before the start of the LeSS adoption, many activities were scattered across the organization. Examples are the execution of regression tests, fixing bugs, other support (all spread across many component teams) and testing & releasing the product (separated team). From the start of the LeSS adoption, teams shared these activities. For example support duty and releasing the product were done by teams on turns (‘duty’). Executing regression tests and fixing bugs were - mostly, except for high urgency bugs - done by (automated) selection and if needed discussed in Sprint Planning 1.

Teams took more responsibility for these ‘pains’ this way, and created more understanding of broader product matters by teams. Teams could do more - often small - improvements in how these things were done. E.g. when they develop a new feature, often they created automated tests as well, which made regression testing easier, faster and better. Before, the pains led to delays in delivery and quality problems in the product, which is significantly better now all teams (can) take responsibility for them. Though these pains weren’t gone - even not after 2 years in the adoption -, the teams reduced the pains significantly and at least didn’t block the delivery of value. Most ‘pain’ right now is for teams having these ‘duties’ and working on these pains instead of developing (customer) features. Slowly, this is improving as well, but the biggest pains are at least conquered. To improve technical excellence, it is important that teams have - and can take - the responsibility about the technical health, so they are able to do something about it.

The Product Owner (before the co-founder became PO) - and the product marketing team - didn’t prioritize much of the technical excellence work on the Product Backlog and they didn’t encourage teams much to increase the technical excellence (e.g. by asking to leave code better than teams found it). Enthusiasts still moved important initiatives forward, and teams still improved frustrating things related to technical excellence, but it never got the attention and focus teams wanted, to be able to make more impact. Teams often still preferred the delivery of PBI’s for customers because of the pressure they felt on this.

However, the technical excellence workshops and attention didn’t bring the value that was expected and desired. The results of the initial Improvement Kata looked promising, but they were not focused. Toyota Kata includes one challenge and one next target condition, to have more focus on the improvement. There should have been focus on one next target condition instead of three. On top of that, nobody took the lead to create a monthly iteration on the improvements and the discipline to follow-up on this. This way, there was almost no transparency about progress and no possibility to inspect & adapt.

The Product Owner should - at least - encourage technical excellence and take it into account in the product vision and balance it with customer needs. Teams should drive technical excellence forward themselves, but they should feel support from the Product Owner. Especially in an environment with teams that were not used to taking responsibility for technical excellence. Team representatives identified that larger ‘improvements’ were needed to bring technical excellence to a higher level, which would take significant amounts of time from teams. End of 2019, beginning of 2020, some teams and a Scrum Master were proactive in moving technical excellence forward. They included the Product Owner, some other important stakeholders and even the CEO in the technical excellence topic to drive it. They made significant improvements in the build pipeline, updating/upgrading of old versions/tools and some small improvements in code quality. A big accomplishment from the drivers was the higher transparency they created on future work on technical excellence on the Product Backlog and the continuous discussions about this with the Product Owner (and even the CEO). This led to more focus on small improvements, but the Product Owner often still postponed other and bigger technical excellence improvements to move forward with ‘urgent’ customer requests (or strategy changes). This improvement when the co-founder became PO and encouraged technical excellence related improvements.

## 附录B： 为启动LeSS的4天活动所做的准备为期4天LeSS实施启动的准备活动 Appendix B: Preparation to the 4-day events that kicked off the LeSS adoption

### B.1 现场工作坊的远程准备 Remote preparation of on-site workshops

从组织、工作流程和当前代码的技术健康度等不同角度对Y Soft研发情况进行分析，是准备工作的开始。远程准备工作的目标是了解Y Soft的现状，更好地了解Y Soft和Co-Learning（作为LeSS实施的合作伙伴），并共同学习下一步的行动方案。

An analysis of the Y Soft R&D context from different perspectives started the preparation: organizational, work processes and technical health of the actual code. The goal of the remote preparation is to learn about the current state of Y Soft, to acquire a better understanding for both Y Soft and Co-Learning (as the partner in the LeSS adoption) and to learn together about next steps.


从对 Soft内部工具使用情况着手，开始做分析，比如Confluence，企业内部ERP的打印输出物等，以进行组织评估。此外，还与Y Soft的Scrum Master和产品总监进行了访谈，以获取更多的澄清和理解的确认。组织评估的结果为LeSS实施准备的后续活动提供了指导，例如组织改进Kata现场工作坊，以重新设计组织结构。工作流程的评估也是通过类似的方式进行的，包括分析Y Soft流程工具的Confluence和Jira，并进行访谈以获取更多信息和确认。

It started with an analysis on Y Soft internal tools like Confluence and printouts out of Y Soft’s internal ERP system, for the organizational assessment. Additionally, interviews with Scrum Masters and the head of Product within Y Soft to get more clarity and validate the understanding. The organizational assessment led to insights to cover in the following steps in the preparation for LeSS adoption, like the on-site organizational improvement kata workshop to redesign the organizational structure. The assessments of the work processes were done similarly by analyzing Y Soft’s Confluence and Jira, and interviews to get more information and validation.

技术健康度的评估有：
* 结合Git的提交记录，利用gource.io（版本可视化工具）可视化代码项目（git project）的发展过程 （如下图）
* 分析Bamboo的构建计划和部署计划，包括失败情况、成功率、运行时间等。
* 分析现有的分支策略和从git中生成的架构文档。

The evaluation of the technical health:

* Using a dump of the commit logs in combination with gource.io (see image below).
* Analyzing Bamboo build plans and deployment plans, failures, success rates, run times etc.
* Analyzing branching strategies in place and architectural documentation extracted from git.

这些技术健康度评估被用于和开发人员一起验证并学习如何改进。例如，开发团队吸取的一个学习点是，曾经只有个别人员具备的知识点（特定组件或技术），要确保在团队自设计过程中能有效传播，从而让全部团队成员都有机会学习到这类知识，减少技能瓶颈。

These were used to validate and learn with the developers how to improve. An example  learning point that developers took, is to make sure that the knowledge of people that are the single points of knowledge (of certain components or technologies) would be spread amongst teams in the team self-design and to make sure team members could learn this knowledge.

技术健康度评估结果的图形化概览如下：

A graphical overview of the outcomes of the evaluation of the technical health looked like this:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/y-soft-gource.png" alt="Y Soft Gource Output">
</figure>

在LeSS实施准备过程中，下述初始评估结果被指出：

* 对于相对小的组织，存在较多的管理层级
* 没有明确的产品负责人 - 有团队PO，架构师和项目经理，然而这些角色在Scrum中是不存在的。
* 长期处于“救火”状态，解决突发紧急情况，追求表面的完成状态。
* Jira工作流中存在很多状态与员工实际工作不匹配
* 大约有75个明确的待办
* 总共898个构建计划，最长构建时间25小时，50个构建计划连续失败。
* 发布很困难，需要很多时间，因为每个团队聚焦在一个具体组件的具体模块上。

The following results from the initial evaluation were addressed in the preparation of the LeSS adoption:

* Many management layers for a reasonably small organization
* No clear Product Owner - there are “Team PO’s”, Architects and Project Managers while these roles don’t exist in Scrum
* In a constant state of firefighting and checkbox hunting
* Jira workflows with more status differences than employees working with it
* +/- 75 explicit backlogs
* 898 build plans in total, maximum build time 25 hours, 50 build plans in continuous failure
* Releasing was difficult and took a lot of time, since each team focused on a specific part around (a) component(s)

这些结果在研讨会上得到了验证，并作为在四天活动里工作坊的准备工作。

The results were validated in workshops and taken as preparation for the 4-day event’s workshops.

### B.2 全员培训 （2018年8月） Educate everyone (August 2018)

LeSS指南*启动*的第一步：全员培训。VP和Scrum Master全都参加了Jürgen de Smet的CLP课程，从而更深刻的理解LeSS。对全部工程师，以及一些潜在的LeSS实施志愿者，我们组织了一轮面向LeSS组织的乐高Scrum工作坊（Lego 4 Scrum）。为了挑选出合适的志愿者，以及确定适合他们参与的领域，Jürgen把工作坊组织得十分激烈。重点是让大家理解与其他团队、与客户以及用户的协作是极其重要的。

The first step of the LeSS guide *Getting Started* is: educate everyone. The VP’s and Scrum Masters all joined Jürgen de Smet’s CLP to get a deeper understanding of LeSS. For all developers - and some others - potentially volunteering in the LeSS adoption, there was a Lego 4 Scrum workshop towards a LeSS organization. Jürgen made the workshop very intense, to really get the right volunteers and to know where they would sign up for. Emphasis is to understand it’s extremely important to collaborate with other teams, customers and users.

### B.3 始组织改进Kata （2018年8月） Initial Organizational Improvement Kata (August 2018)

基于前期准备的结果，按照Toyota Kata方法，掀起了一场组织改进Kata活动。设定的方向与挑战是，在为期4天的活动之后，找到最适合开启LeSS的组织结构。

Based on the results from the preparation, an Organizational Improvement Kata was organized, based on the Toyota Kata approach. The direction and challenge that was set forward was to find the optimal organizational structure for starting in the LeSS adoption after the 4-day event.

在这次工作坊中，研发、人力资源、产品营销、商业部门的分管VP和部分中层管理者（C-Level）一起探讨了他们当前的组织结构，并与准备阶段所验证的结果相结合。请注意，并没有财务部门的代表出席，这在很多情况下都会有所帮助。因为财务政策通常对组织结构有很大的影响，在转向LeSS时应该重新考虑。参会者们发现了有利的模式和不那么有利的模式，并将它们记录下来进行了讨论。结果如下图所示。

In this workshop, the VP’s in R&D, HR, product marketing, Business and part of C-Level explored their current organizational setup in combination with validate findings from the preparation. Note that there was no Finance representative present, which in many cases would be beneficial. Financial policies often have big influence on the organizational patterns and should be reconsidered when moving towards LeSS. The participants discovered favorable patterns and less favorable patterns and these were noted down and discussed. The results are in the pictures below.

*在现状下，通过“搅局者游戏”获得的结果:*

*Results from the Meddlers game on current situation:*

</figure>

现状的积极之处：
* 聚焦组件，在组件的垂直领域具备较深的知识积累
* 所有请求都归集于产品
* 用户体验与安全归属于研发
* 聚焦支持
* 大量的内部知识

Positive about the current situation:

* Component focus and deep knowledge of components
* Product is a central point for all requests
* UX & Security knowledge is within R&D
* Focus on support
* Lot of internal knowledge

现状的待改进项：
* 团队间互相等待较多
* 产品级的构建流水线不能有效的工作
* 几乎收不到生产环境的反馈
* 从生产环境到团队，没有直接的信息流
* 传递给团队的需求，并不是客户真正想要的
* 角色职责定义不清
* 支持类工作会打断新需求开发
* 升级会经过不同的的渠道
* 文档不健全

Improvements for the current situation:

* Teams wait for each other a lot
* The build pipeline doesn’t work well on product level
* Almost no feedback back from the field
* No direct information flow to teams from the field
* Requests that go to the teams are not what the customer actually wanted
* No clarity for roles
* Support interrupts new development
* Escalations go through different channels
* Documentation is not right

一个被选定的小组正在进行“Management3.0”的“搅局者游戏”，通过这个游戏设计未来的组织状态。他们挖掘不同的模式选项，选择喜欢的去进一步优化，并消除大多数（并非全部）不喜欢的选项。

A selected group was working to design a future state using the Meddlers Game from Management 3.0. They  explored options to elevate the favorable patterns discovered and eliminate most (not to say all) less favorable patterns.

在组织重新设计后，继续由这个小组决定产品是什么。定义产品是LeSS指南*启动*的第二步。通过“全员培训”的志愿者们被添加到组织设计的反馈链中，可以收到组织设计结果。这个小组成员一起做了一个*特性团队实施地图*练习。LeSS指南*特性团队实施地图*有助于可视化LeSS实施过程中组织变革的演进路径。*特性团队实施地图*在一个轴上展示团队工作范围逐渐变大，在另一个轴上展示团队跨职能的程度逐步加深。这帮助团队获得更深刻的组织设计洞见，也有助于大家确定4天LeSS启动活动的边界范围。

The same group defined together what ‘product’ could mean in the context of the new organizational setup. Define product is the second step in the LeSS guide *Getting Started*. Volunteers from the ‘educate everyone’ session were added to get feedback on the results for the organizational setup. The whole group did a Feature Team Adoption Map exercise. This LeSS guide *Feature Team Adoption Maps* helps to make transparent the kind of organizational change you can expect for the LeSS adoption. It’s a representation of the gradually increasing work scope of the teams on one axis and the degree of cross-functionality of teams on the other axis.  It resulted in insights on the organizational setup and to set boundaries of what is in scope for the 4-day event that starts the LeSS adoption.

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/feature-team-adoption-mapping.png" alt="Feature Team Adoption Mapping">
</figure>

一旦范围明确后，该小组继续使用特性团队实施地图（Feature Team Adoption map），去识别对工具使用许可证、不同研发地点的可用硬件等方面的相关需求，以及不同团队和研发地点的在技术能力方面的差异。

Once the scope was cleared out, the group continued with the Feature Team Adoption map to discover the needs in relation to licenses for tooling, hardware available on different development locations, skill gaps within current teams and locations and more.

其他工作坊还包括如何收集需求，验证技术评估结果，以及让领导们理解LeSS原则。事后反思，应该组织一个关于Scrum基础和原则的工作坊或者培训，因为并非所有开发人员都了解这些知识。

Other workshops included e.g. how to gather requirements, validating the results from the technical evaluation and an understanding of the LeSS principles to managers. In hindsight, there should have been a workshop or training about the essence and principles of Scrum, which was not common knowledge for all developers.

接下来，我们将需求和准备工作分类放到待办事项列表中，分别标记为“4天活动前必须完成的事项”、“4天活动期间的事项”和“4天活动后的事项”。这个待办列表对应的wiki页面在Y Soft公司内部十分有名，它列出了志愿者们为准备为期4天的LeSS实施启动活动而需要采取的行动。启动活动目标定于2018年11月举行。

Next, we classified the needs and preparation into a backlog with categories for ‘must before 4-day event’, ‘during 4-day event’ and ‘after 4-day event’. This list became a famous wiki page within Y Soft with actions to take in the course of preparing their 4-day event starting the LeSS adoption by the volunteers. The aim was set to have that event in November 2018.

这个Wiki页面看起来是这样的：

The Wiki page looked like this:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/less-activities-wiki.png" alt="LeSS Activities Wiki">
</figure>

并没有一个正式的“变革团队”来参与并推进这些步骤，而是由一群（非常多的）志愿者来领导这次变革。然而，不利的一面是志愿者团队成员不固定，有时会人员进出，这使得推动变革更加困难。一小群人 - 主要是Scrum Masters - 主动站出来确保志愿者们能够做正确的事情。人们加入了志愿者团队，但对志愿者的期望是在会议中设定的，而不是事先预定的。

There was no official ‘change team’ that joined and worked on these steps, but a (large) group of volunteers that led the change. However, the downside is that people appeared and disappeared from the volunteering group, which made it harder to move things forward. A small group - Scrum Masters mainly - took the lead to make sure the volunteers could do the right things. People joined the volunteering group, but the expectations for them were set at the meetings instead of set in advance.

准备活动的目标与工作坊的沟通应该做得更多和更好。这样会使志愿者们能够更加清楚期待他们做什么，他们的贡献也会更加聚集有效。

The communication about the preparation goals and the workshops should have been done more and better. This would have made volunteers more aware of what was expected and their contribution would have been more dedicated.

一个重要发现是，没有人愿意做重新定义后产品的产品负责人。
An important observation was that nobody wanted to be the Product Owner for the newly defined product.

### B.4 准备为期4天的LeSS启动活动 Preparing the 4-day event starting the LeSS adoption

在Y Soft，由VP和Scrum Master主导4天启动活动的准备。并没有因此专门成立一个变更小组，全部活动组织的职责都由志愿者承担。志愿者们每周同步2次进展，并讨论下一步工作计划。

Within Y Soft, the VP and the Scrum Masters took the lead to further prepare the 4-day event. There was no official change team and the responsibilities for all activities were taken by volunteers. The volunteers met twice a week to synchronize on progress and discuss and plan next steps.

活动之一是成立社区（在那个时候被称为“实践社区”，并且这个术语迄今仍在Y Soft内使用），以便团队之间方便知识分享。LeSS指南*社区*就是为了重点解决跨团队事宜，比如技能、标准、工具和设计。推荐的社区包括设计/架构社区和测试社区，开发人员有时会被要求成立他们认为有用的社区，这会导致过多无实际作用的社区。这些社区“成立”之初，有举办会议，但没有明确的目标，也缺乏相关知识的分享。当Scrum Masters意识到他们没有运营社区的经验时，他们尝试借助外部支持从他人那里获取知识。这最终产出了一份实验清单，列出了人们在运营内部社区时可以尝试或需要避免的实验。

One activity was to set up communities (at that time still called ‘Communities of Practice’ and this terminology is still used in Y Soft) to be able to share knowledge between teams. The LeSS guide *Communities* is there to address cross-team concerns about e.g. skills, standards, tools and designs. Recommended communities include design/architecture and test. Developers were asked to set up communities they thought were useful, which resulted in many “communities” without any real impact. These communities “started”, there were meetings, but they had no clear goal and limited sharing of relevant knowledge. When the Scrum Masters realized that they don’t have experience with running communities, they used the external support to acquire knowledge from others. This resulted in a list of experiments people can try or avoid running internal communities.

有些Y Soft内部社区把社区作为一种控制工作的手段，例如组件相关的工作，对于自管理的团队来说已经不再围绕组件来工作了。安全社区则使团队成员对安全有了深入的认知，并提高了产品的安全质量，Scrum Master认为这是一个成功的社区案例。该社区在每个团队引入了“安全主席”的角色，也就是每个团队的参与安全社区的代表，负责把他们获取到的安全知识传播到各自团队中。到了2021年，只有少数几个社区（测试/质量保证社区、开发实践社区）仍在运行，还在经常分享知识或促进质量提升。让社区持续运作起来的主要经验是，要支持人们以明确的目标去组织和构建社区，并且这个目标在社区成员间要达成共识，同时要有一位对社区运营充满热情、有意愿经营社区的协调人员。

Some of the communities that were set up within Y Soft used the community as a way to control work for e.g. components, which was dysfunctional for the self-managing of the teams. The Security community led to strong knowledge of team members on security and increased quality of security in the product, which the Scrum Masters considered as a success story. The community introduced ‘security champions’ in each team that joined the community and spread their knowledge into the teams. In 2021, there were just a few communities (test/Quality Assurance, development practices) still running and frequently sharing knowledge or improving quality. The main lesson to get communities working is to support people into organizing and structuring communities with a clear - and aligned between members - goal of the community with a community coordinator that has passion for the concern and a desire to cultivate a strong community.

此外，外部支持也常被用于组织深度的技术工作坊。在事件风暴（Event Stroming）工作坊中，志愿者们把（技术）架构师拉向前与业务场景相链接。团队需要从聚焦组件转变为聚焦整个产品，而且这些洞见能够帮助团队更好的理解产品。另外，在专注逐步重构的内部代码静修（Code retreat）工作坊活动中，引入一些必要的工程实践，帮助团队向前发展。人们可以在他们团队内部使用工作坊中学到的知识。通过这种方式，实现了将全部组件集成为一个产品，包括支持，发布和其他活动。

Additionally external support was used to organize several in-depth technical workshops. In an event-storming workshop, volunteers linked their (technical) architecture back to business context. Teams had to move from a component focus to a whole-product focus, and these insights helped teams to better understand that whole product. Additionally, there was an internal Code Retreat on baby-step refactoring to bring in some necessary engineering practices for teams to move ahead. People could use the learnings of this workshop in their teams. This way, they could integrate all components in one product, including support, releasing and other activities.

*技术工作坊*

*Technical workshops:*

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/technical-workshops.png" alt="Technical Workshops">
</figure>

在准备工作中，一项最重要的活动是寻找产品负责人。通过内部搜索与沟通，产品营销副总裁（VP）担任了产品负责人的角色，这与1993年Easel首次实施Scrum类似。他所负责部门的产品营销人员可以帮助团队获得必要的客户理解。

One of the crucial activities that was needed in the preparation was to find a Product Owner. After searching and discussing this internally, the VP of product marketing took the role of Product Owner, as in the very first Scrum adoption at Easel in 1993. The people in his department from product marketing would help teams to get the needed customer understanding.

为了鼓励人们参与到准备工作中来，Scrum Master们组织了“开放空间”和“精益咖啡”等活动，让人们能够分享进展，并解决他们遇到的困难、恐惧或问题。*开放空间*是LeSS指南所推荐的，用于定期学习和协作，让参会者自组织加入。

To engage people in the preparation steps, the Scrum Masters organized Open Spaces & Lean Coffees, where people could share the progress and address their struggles, fears or questions. *Open Space* is one of the LeSS guides for learning & coordination regularly to have participants self-organize in.

然而，LeSS实施的沟通工作是失败的。首先，沟通主要在志愿者内部进行，利用Wiki工具。这导致对未参与志愿者活动的人来说透明度很低。其次，人们忽视了Scrum Master发送的更新邮件。结果是，Scrum Master和负责变革的VP不得不花费大量时间精力去通知每个人，让大家对四天活动的保持信息一致。从这四天活动开始，负责变革的VP成为该产品的产品总监，也是这个产品唯一剩余的副总裁。

However, the communication about the LeSS adoption was failing. First, the communication was mainly done between the volunteers and with the use of Wiki. This led to low transparency to others that weren’t involved in the volunteering activities. And second, people ignored the mails that the Scrum Masters sent with updates. Consequence was that Scrum Masters and the VP that led the change had much more work to inform everyone and get them on the same page for the 4-day event. The VP that led the change became the Head of Product from the 4-day event on, as the only remaining VP for the product.

## Appendix C: 4-day event that started the LeSS adoption

In January of 2019, the 4-day event took place. All possible volunteers would join, including the Product Owner, management and some other supporting roles. The Head of Product explained to everyone the reason for the change in the introduction. In this section, we describe the steps of the event.

### Day 1: initial Product Backlog Refinement (initial PBR)

The Product Owner shared the product vision as a starting point for initial Product Backlog Refinement. The LeSS guide of *initial PBR* is to make sure that teams have a Product Backlog with enough understood items to start working. It’s important to do at the start of a LeSS adoption, because usually the so-called “Product Backlogs” that exist follow the old structure, often functional or component focused instead of customer-focused. With feature teams, the Product Backlog Items (PBI’s) will be customer-focused and therefore the old “Product Backlogs” will often not be useful, but can be a good source for the initial PBR. Among several other reasons why initial PBR is important, it’s needed to make sure teams understand the PBI’s, instead of having PBI’s written down by one person, team or someone else and assuming others understand it.

*Product Owner sharing vision:*

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/product-owner-sharing-vision.png" alt="Product Owner Sharing Vision">
</figure>

The product vision was the starting point for the initial PBR, done together by all participants. First, engineers created a marketplace with 10 slots, so there would be around 6 people per item. People added items to the marketplace so each slot had an item (or several items) to refine in that slot. People worked in several iterations, and each iteration would go into more detail. After each iteration, people shared the results to each other in something like a LeSS Sprint Review Bazaar, but only for item analysis, not done features

*Example of a refinement slot discussion:*

</figure>

After the Refinement iterations, groups of people did ‘mob documenting’, where they added the results of the Refinement to the Wiki and the Product Backlog. In the break, the Scrum Masters printed all items for the next step: estimation. Participants used slide & deal techniques to estimate all the items: participants placed items in categories and big categories were split further to get better estimations. The picture below shows how the items were placed on the floor and people categorized them.

</figure>

### Day 2: Creating the Definition of Done & self-design the team

Everyone participated in a Definition of Done workshop, to get to a common Definition of Done (DoD) for the product. According to the LeSS guide *Creating the Definition of Done*, it was created before the first Sprint starts. Participants re-grouped with other people than in earlier sessions (8 groups) and started working with an initial DoD that was prepared in advance. In this group, they defined what activities are needed to be potentially shippable for the product. After the draft from each group, two groups came together to get to a common DoD for the two groups. This was repeated again, two (combined) groups came together to get to a common DoD for the two (originally four) groups. And finally, the last four DoD’s were made into 1 DoD with the entire group. These facilitation techniques were used from the LeSS guide *Cross-Team Meetings*, with diverge-merge cycles to create diversity in groups (with mixed groups), and merge back to get to one common result.

After that, they did an ‘undone’ workshop to discover which activities can be done each Sprint (following the LeSS guide *Creating the Definition of Done*). People divided activities that weren’t on the DoD - meaning teams weren’t able to get that ‘done’ - into the groups. Each group defined how the activities will get done (when, where & what) to identify all the missing pieces to get to a ‘perfect’ DoD and to be able to ship the product to customers. Teams would use this Definition of Undone to improve the DoD in the future. It gave teams transparency with whom to collaborate closely with about what. This gave the teams insight how to deal with (certain types of) ‘undone’ work and what opportunities are there to improve the DoD in the future.

*Definition of Done workshop:*

</figure>

Then, people ‘burned’ their old teams. Teams made materials about their current teams and what it meant to them. They literally burned these materials, as a way of saying goodbye to the old teams and being able to design the new teams with a fresh mind.

*Burning of old teams:*

  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/burning-old-team-2.png" alt="Burning of Old Team 2">
</figure>


Then, the team self-design workshop started. One of the LeSS adoption principles is *Use volunteering*, to engage people and it gives people the feeling of being empowered. An important part of this is to self-design the teams, meaning to let people decide themselves how the team looks like. The criteria for the self-design for the teams were:

* Team is co-located
* Size is between 6 and 10 people
* Being able to deliver as much of PBI’s independently as possible
* High diversity of skills and personalities

Before starting the workshop, it was announced that only volunteers that want to be a team member (following the ‘Use Volunteering’ adoption principle), Scrum Masters and managers could stay in the room, because they are the ones that are going to work together primarily in the new setting. All other people were requested to leave. Some architects were leaving and decided not to be part of a team. Each volunteer filled in a template ‘personal character sheet’. They included personal skills, technology skills and other important things that they wanted to add to their sheet. This sheet was used in each iteration of the team self-design subsequently.

The organizers set tables as places for a team, and people could move through the tables and decide to go to a team (diverge). Each table/team discussed what that team would need from its members and how they scored on the constraints. They filled in a team sheet to evaluate the combination of skills from the personal character sheet. After each iteration, each team shared their status with the other teams in a review (merge), to keep the overview. In each iteration, teams identified possible improvements for the next iteration. After three iterations, all team members were at least ‘ok’ with the team setup and that meant that the initial teams were final.

*Team self-design discussion:*

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/team-self-design-discussion.png" alt="Team Self Design Discussion">
</figure>

### Day 3: Team agreements & follow-up with teams

Teams started day 3 with the final iteration of self-design. After the team self-design, teams worked on several things to get to some team agreements:

* Team name
* Team song
* Guiding principles to weigh options and make decisions
* Potential struggles for the team and how to cope with that
* Work agreements

The teams were also able to choose a Scrum Master from the group of Scrum Masters (constraint: co-located). After that, each team did a Done/Undone review in its team, to learn which parts of the DoD they were able to deliver and where they should improve.

Then, participants discussed the support for the product. Besides customer features, there will be other types of work, often bugs or defects coming in, often ‘sudden’ and not plannable. A support department within Y Soft takes care of first, second and third level support of the product, directly with customers. If the support department can’t fix the problem for the customer or needs R&D for that, they create a ‘level 4’ support ticket that is handled by R&D (meaning: the teams). The newly formed teams decided that one team per Sprint takes care of these level 4 support tickets and works with the support department (and customers sometimes) to fix these problems. This team is the fast-response team from the LeSS guide *Handling Special Items*, that enables a rotating responsibility shared among the teams for support and gives the other teams focus. Because the teams in the old structure were component focused and handled this support separately, for many teams it meant that they didn’t have the knowledge to support all tickets, and as a consequence they needed to learn that.

Additionally, teams agreed on distributed decision making models to make sure bugs (defects) are categorized and follow-ed up. The support team makes sure that categorization happens and needs to act when there is a high priority bug that has to be fixed as soon as possible. In the workshop, teams created a bug matrix to categorize bugs.

In advance, the Scrum Masters printed 100 open bugs and 100 recently closed bugs and created x- and y-axis on the floor. Teams chose ‘bug severity’ for the x-axis and ‘customer impact’ for the y-axis. Team members were asked to put the printed bugs relative to each other on the floor. After quite some bugs were added to the floor, they created some clusters. At that point, the organizers extended the x-axis and y-axis with 9 blocks, like this:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/bug-matrix.png" alt="Bug Matrix">
</figure>

The rules that were set forward were that all bugs had to be in one category (not on the line), and bugs would be placed relative to each other within the category. The good thing about doing this on the floor is that lines can be extended to left, right, top or bottom (as long as you don’t make the initial lines too close to the wall). The left and bottom categories usually stay quite empty, so then you can move the lines a bit and the second cells from the left will be the new left cells.

After adding all the bugs, together teams decided how each of the 9 cells were ‘categorized’ how they should be handled. The team with support duty could compare all new bugs to bugs that were categorized before and categorize a new bug, enabling a distributed decision making model.

*Bug matrix:*

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/bug-matrix-floor.png" alt="Bug Matrix Floor">
</figure>

### Day 4: Sprint Planning

On the last day of the event, teams did their first Sprint Planning One in the new setup, following the LeSS guide *Sprint Planning One*. Jürgen explained the purpose of the Sprint Planning and the guidelines of the Sprint Planning. The Product Owner opened the Sprint Planning by explaining the priorities from his perspective.

Each team shared which availability they have for the upcoming Sprint (holidays, meetings etc.) and the things they needed to finish that were already in progress. Additionally, they added bugs (with a high categorization from the bug matrix) to solve. Then, there was a bazaar for teams to share their selection and design of their Sprint, for the PBI’s they picked themselves. These PBI’s were printed so teams could grab them to select and discuss with other teams who would pick which PBI.

In the next step, each team crafted a Sprint Goal individually. Then, all Sprint Goals were collected and there was an agreement on an Overall Sprint Goal for all teams combined for the upcoming Sprint. Important to mention is that LeSS - in contrast to Scrum - doesn’t require a Sprint Goal. When useful and when there is a natural clear overall goal, it’s good to apply. But when there isn’t a natural clear overall goal (e.g. because of the heterogeneity of work across teams), then it’s better to not have a common Sprint Goal.

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/sprint-goal.png" alt="Sprint Goal">
</figure>

Each team selected the - printed - PBI’s they want to work on into their Sprint Backlog (Magic Whitepaper on the wall) in their team space in the room. In the LeSS guide *Multi-Team Sprint Planning Two*, it’s emphasized to have the Sprint Planning Two in the same room with all teams, to be able to coordinate with other teams using the ‘*just talk*’ or ‘*just scream*’ technique. Team members looked at the selection of other teams with the instruction to minimize dependencies between teams and move things from teams to other teams. In LeSS, there are no dependencies, because each Feature Team has the necessary knowledge and skills to complete an end-to-end customer-centric feature. If not, the team is expected to learn or acquire the needed knowledge and skill. The teams were new, and therefore some features didn’t have teams yet with all the knowledge and skills to deliver it end-to-end. In Sprint Planning Two, the teams coordinated between each other how to deliver the features end-to-end, with help from knowledge and skills from other teams if needed, preferably by learning them. This way, there is no dependency, because the teams together - at the same time - make sure the features get done. In hindsight, the instruction to minimize dependencies might have given the wrong perception to teams, because the focus should be on learning or acquiring the knowledge and skills, by working together with the other teams. And these are not dependencies, but simply working together to learn and get features to done. Over time, that should have eliminated the perception of having dependencies, by giving the right message.

After Sprint Planning One, each team did their design on how to get things done in their Sprint Planning Two, following the *Multi-Team Sprint Planning Two* LeSS guide. A bazaar was done so teams could see what other teams had crafted and to be able to align if needed. Teams were asked whether the results were good enough to start the first Sprint. After that, teams did another iteration to get more specific results in their ‘plan’ of the Sprint and subsequently the ‘administration’ to update the Product Backlog and their Sprint Backlogs.

At the end, all participants celebrated with a dancing challenge! And from that moment the new teams would start working together in the new structure.

## Appendix D: Preparation and start event of the second experiment of OD changes

### Team design workshop 1

Goal of this workshop: determine the fixed team size number, form (draft) team designs, and check/learn about the possibility of end-to-end feature delivery by teams.

In the preparation, the Head of Product and the Scrum Masters communicated about:

* The constraints for the teams (co-located, fixed team size number across all teams & one person in one team only).
* What does it mean to deliver end-to-end with a team? Including what it means for ‘new’ roles for the teams like UX specialists and business analysts.
* Tips for designing the teams based on the previous team design.
* Question & Answer on questions from team members.

There are three sites with teams working on the product. On the biggest site (more than 50% of the teams), teams already started an initiative to improve the current team designs. From that initiative, a couple of team members helped in preparing for the workshop. Important input from these team members was e.g. the current status of the (draft) teams and the most common team size number.

*Reflection*: because the 3 sites differ in size (8 teams after the workshop on one site and 2 + 3 on the two other sites), we could have differentiated the way the 3 sites were preparing and participating in the workshop. The individual team discussions about who would be in which team, were much heavier for the biggest site. For the two smaller sites, the involvement from teams in some parts of the self-designing iterations was significantly smaller. For similar future situations, it would be good to consider how smaller sites would participate, but still include them in deciding how the team of teams as a whole would optimize best.

Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, this workshop was fully remote. Possibly one of the first team design workshops in LeSS fully remote. To be inclusive for everyone and to have an effective workshop, we used an online collaboration tool (Miro) heavily combined with Zoom to work in breakout sessions to discuss in teams.

So, how did the workshop look like:

1. <u>Responsibility Process</u><br/> remind everyone to take responsibility for crafting the best possible teams for the product.
2. <u>Identify current challenges from teams to deliver features end-to-end</u>: not only to take into account in the team design, but also to learn from after the workshop to increase (cross-functional) learning. Participants took 5 minutes to individually (and silently) add sticky notes to the area in the board. After that, theyr read other sticky notes for 3 minutes, and clustered and categorized the sticky notes. We did a small voting round to have a quick overview which of the categories were deemed most important.
3. <u>Determine definitive team size</u><br/>All participants did an exercise to add pros and cons to the proposed sizes of 6 & 7 and to be able to add alternatives. We took the time to decide together with the teams what the fixed number would be. Some teams discussed it already in advance and came with 6 or 7 people per team as the best number. In the online collaboration tool, we put those options at the board and asked the participants two things, (1) Add pro’s & con’s per option, and (2) Add other options and arguments for that option (if any)<br/><br/>Two options were added: 8 people per team and 6 + 2 people per team. 2 people meaning: ‘non-developer’ roles, e.g. UX specialists or business analysts. This way a team could have 6 ‘developers’ and optionally add ‘non-developer’ roles, so there would be teams of 6, 7 & 8 in that scenario.<br/><br/>After the longest discussion of all workshops - a little over 20 minutes with 90+ people - participants voted for the (fixed team size) number. One of the team members suggested doing two rounds: a second round for the top 2 options, where also voters from the lowest 2 options could vote again for one of the top 2 options. The Scrum Masters expected that making a decision would be harder, but it was easier than expected. The fixed number of 7 was chosen by a clear majority. Afterwards, some people were happy about the size of the discussion as well: ‘it would have been longer if we had done this co-located’ and ‘because of the facilitation the discussion was kept to a minimum’. The teams felt more involved, because we asked the teams to come up with the fixed team size number. It felt better than a ‘directed’ decision. Even though, statistically, the chance to reach the number 7 is almost certain for any large group.<br/><br/>This fixed team size is unique for a LeSS adoption, and it’s definitely interesting to reflect on this. However, it doesn’t fit well in the setup of this case study. The downsides were small and after this event there was rarely a mention to this. An unexpected positive upside was that teams were very reflective and critical of the skills they added to their teams, because they had an upper-limit of seven people in their team. This made the team self-design reflective and people didn’t ‘just join’ teams, but were seriously discussing this before deciding on it.
4. <u>Self-design iteration 1</u><br/>The first iteration was short, because of the preparations many of the participants did. We created team numbers in Miro with spaces per team to add names per round and evaluate per round. In the first round, we asked people to add their names to a team that makes sense to them and copy their preparations. This would be used to have a starting point, but also to check whether every team member was actually participating in the workshop.
5. <u>Self design iteration 2</u><br/>The second round was a full iteration. The team numbers corresponded with the breakout sessions numbers. We asked people to add their name to a team in the second round (95% was the same as in the first round of course) and join the breakout session of that team. We asked them to discuss their current team, what they loved about this team, what they could improve in this team and how ‘diverse’ the team was. Some people were moving between teams and a lot of discussions happened. After the iteration, everybody got 10 minutes to read the outcomes of all the teams and ask questions if there was unclarity. After this round, the foundation was there with 13 teams, but there were some open ends (e.g. not every team had the correct size, a few people not happy with their place in a team).
6. <ul>Check upcoming work and how they could be delivered by the teams</u><br/>In the third round, a selection of the Epics (*note: an ‘Epic’ is a cluster of PBI’s together in Y Soft, following the tooling they use for the PBL*) were prepared on the Miro board by the Scrum Masters in a table. Each team could indicate whether they can deliver that Epic end-to-end or were willing and able to learn it. We asked them to copy the Epics and drag them to their team’s space: either to 1) we are able to deliver it end-to-end or 2) we are able and **willing to** learn to deliver it end-to-end. We made the learning part for the Epics explicit to encourage teams to focus on customer centric features end-to-end more in the future. Teams evaluated the possible Epics for their team and added a green sticky note (we can deliver it end-to-end) or an orange sticky note (we are able and willing to learn to deliver it end-to-end) to the main table.<br/><br/>*Reflection*: we made clear in advance that we wouldn’t use the results about which teams could deliver which Epics afterwards. There was fear of some teams that this transparency would be used to challenge them later why they wouldn’t work on a certain Epic. Of course, teams could use this transparency themselves afterwards if they wanted to.
7. <u>Reflection and closing<u/><br/>Participants added one thing they were happy about in the workshop and (maximum) one possible concern for the team design. This input was used by team members, but also by the Head of Product to work on during the time between the first and the second workshop.

We split the team design workshop in two parts on purpose. In co-located team designs, team members often chat in breaks about the team design. Learning from previous team designs is to take 30 minutes breaks between iterations to let that happen. Otherwise, these discussions will happen after the workshop and teams will change afterwards. Remotely, this chat in breaks is hard to accomplish. We organized a week between the first and second workshop, so team members could reflect and discuss open issues or concerns.

We used Miro to facilitate all steps in the workshop. The screenshots (second one not readable on purpose) below give an indication. During each step, the participants themselves were moving in Miro and adding/changing things. At maximum, 95 people were active in Miro at the same time. Most important facilitation tip: don’t have central discussions. Use other techniques for that, like taking 5 or 10 minutes after each breakout session to read the results or adding questions in sticky notes to someone else’s input.

### Team design workshop 2

Goal of this workshop: finalize the team design and identify follow-up steps to improve continuous learning for the future.

In the week between the two workshops, participants discussed many open ends of the team designs. Some teams were too big and some people didn’t have a team yet. The Head of Product addressed that it could be a valid outcome that someone wasn’t part of a team, and teams shouldn’t be forced to include members in their team they didn’t want to. The Scrum Masters, agile coach and Head of Product had a good overview on the status and helped by talking to the right people to get some things moving in between the workshops.

The second workshop had a similar structure to the first one. People used the online collaboration tool in the time between the workshops to keep progress of changes in their team design.

1. <u>Summary per team</u><br/>Every team took 10 minutes to summarize their changes between the workshops and what they needed to do in the subsequent iteration(s). All people read the summaries of the others to be prepared for the next iteration.
2. <u>Self-design iteration 3</u><br/>In this iteration - based on the summary - teams focused on discussing with other teams how to improve further and how to help other teams to improve. At the end of this iteration the teams were ‘ready’, all constraints were fulfilled and the foundation was there.
3. <u>Address blocking concerns</u><br/>Teams voted whether there are blocking concerns to work with the team designs: ‘are you ready to start next Monday in these teams or does something need to be resolved?’ One team had a blocking concern, because they were too big (8 persons instead of 7). We organized a short breakout session about this blocking concern with the Head of Product, the people involved and people from some other teams that could help. One person that was desired to move to another team was sick and therefore both teams didn’t want to make the final decision. We agreed to solve this when this person was back, and teams voted again: ‘after this action point, is there another iteration of self-design needed?’ The answer was no by a large majority (just 2 people wanted another iteration of self-design) and we moved on.
4. <u>Next steps</u><br/>People identified three types of next steps, 1) needed to address on event, 2) needed to address in the first new Sprint, 3) needed to address in the follow-up two Sprints. After that, we voted which of this input to take into account.
5. <u>Reflection and closing</u><br/>Participants again added one thing they were happy about in the workshop and (maximum) one improvement for the facilitation for the actual event on May 11th.

One thing we planned to do in one of the two workshops, but couldn’t do due to a lack of time was to ‘identify learning to improve cross-functionality per team’. Each team would have identified what they need to learn, how they will learn it and what concrete actions they would take to increase their ability to deliver end-to-end. Instead of this, we included this topic explicitly in the Team Canvas on the event.

### Second event with organizational changes

The event kicked off the work in the new teams and working without managers. The event itself was mostly a day of ‘celebration’ and a formal start of a new step. Due to COVID-19, also this event was remote.

The CEO kicked off the event by thanking everyone for their active participation and important contribution to the overall strategy and success of Y Soft. He emphasized that we were able to deliver more value since the start of the LeSS adoption, even with many changes of people in the past (a bit more than a) year. He explained more about the changes in the company strategy and the importance and need for all teams to understand this. He encouraged teams to dive into the strategy and keep challenging the Product Owner and other stakeholders on it. He also talked about the ‘manager-less’ organization, because from that moment all managers in product development were removed. He ended by a vote on what should be on the grill when there is the possibility again for an on-site fun event.

After that, we had all teams together to reflect on the accomplishments and successes of the LeSS adoption that started more than a year before. It was very important to focus on the positive things. The reason to do the event was not because there were no improvements since the start of the LeSS adoption, but simply because the Head of Product - influenced by the CEO - wanted to make another big step forward. We asked team members to draw the accomplishments and successes and this was the result:

</figure>

Next, we asked each team to work on their Team Canvas. We asked them to come up with a team name (and a logo if they wanted). We added space for their ‘roles’ (focused on soft skills) in their team, important team values for them, how they collaborate, and how they make sure they learn (from each other). The exercise had the purpose to focus on their new team and have a starting point for them to work together.

*(small) Reflection*: there was a small insight about the team names: in the support tickets to some customers, the name of the team that solves the ticket is documented. Some team names might not be that good for external communication and there is no cohesion between the names. A possible experiment for next time is to have the teams choose a category together and select a team name belonging to that category. For example Star Wars as a category and ‘Darth Vader’ and ‘Luke Skywalker’ as team names.

*Team canvases*

Before lunch, teams solved a practical matter: the supporting team role. Each Sprint, teams rotate support duty. One team had a proposal to work with a buddy team, so new (hired) teams are up to speed faster in the support role and more learning across teams would be there. A back-up in case of issues would also be arranged this way. Teams that wanted this formed buddy’s and the teams solved this together.

After lunch, there was a small energizer and the topic ‘macro-processes’. Macro-processes are important aspects that used to be taken care of by managers that teams have to take care of themselves from now on. Examples of macro-processes are ‘on-boarding of new employees’ or ‘hiring new employees’. Teams need to take care of the macro-processes - in collaboration with e.g. HR for hiring - and used the time to choose the most important macro-processes. For the first two macro-processes, they made the first draft. In advance, a group of volunteers already made a template structure on how to define these ‘macro-processes’, similar to the LeSS complete picture.

In a brainstorming round, the Agile Coaches asked the teams what the Agile Coaches should focus on to help them:

  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/help-of-coaches.png" alt="Help of the coaches">
</figure>

The Agile Coaches used this input to define what perspectives they should have to have a wider system view and what their roles should be. In a later step, the Agile Coaches decided together who would focus on what.

*Result of discussion between Agile Coaches for their focus*

At the end of the day, all participants checked all the administrative and other operational tasks that needed to happen, because of the change of the teams. We asked all teams to discuss together how they would solve it and add a green sticky note when they were done:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/team-administrative-tasks.png" alt="Teams solving administrative tasks">
</figure>

We did the same thing for some general activities that need to happen and asked people to volunteer to solve them:

<figure>
  <img src="img/case-studies/ysoft/dividing-general-activities.png" alt="Dividing General Activities">
</figure>

The morning after, the first Sprint started with the new teams in the Sprint Planning. We asked as many people to join as possible (instead of only representatives), for two reasons:

* For teams with people that don’t know each other’s skills well yet, they can discuss together to select PBI’s.
* The Product Owner (starting a month the event) had a more strategic outline for the upcoming period prepared.

*Reflection on the workshops*: don’t postpone this kind of changes due to a pandemic: many things are achievable remotely with adjustments. When you postpone, the pain stays there and it’s great for behavior of <u>Larman’s Laws of Organizational Behavior</u> to revert the change.

Another learning is about having an interactive and inclusive way of doing the remote workshop. Make sure participants are engaged during the workshop by letting them give input, go to breakout rooms to have smaller discussions, and have interactions in an online collaboration tool. This makes the participants more involved, and the ‘voice of the loudest’ will be prevented.

Large-group organization and facilitation is a topic on its own. From the learnings at Y Soft, you can read and watch more here:

## Appendix E - adding a full new external team

Y Soft’s CEO and Head of Products wanted to increase the number of teams, to be able to have more capacity to deliver customer requests and strategic features. Here are some learnings about adding a fully new team - from an external vendor.

In the past, a specific vendor already supplied a full team in one of the (development) sites. This same vendor was asked to add a team in one of the other sites. The team could be treated as any other - internal - team and also be included in learning the product, customers and technologies, because there was a long-term contract. The main difference would be that the paycheck for the team members comes from another company. These prerequisites helped to have this new team learn the product like other teams.

The Head of Product announced that there would be a team added to a site, and together with the HR business partner he contacted the other teams in the site to discuss how they could onboard the new team in the best way. The new team would start with 3 people a few weeks later and would grow to a full team in the upcoming months. One of the teams at the site volunteered to help the team onboard and a couple of options were discussed how to onboard them best:

* *Temporarily add the 3 people to the volunteering team*<br/>This option was on the table, but the volunteering team didn’t consider it viable. This would harm their team dynamics for a while and would also not help them on focusing on on-boarding.
* *Start the 3 people team while working on something related to the volunteering team*<br/>In this option, the 3 people team would e.g. write automated tests for the feature of the volunteering team or at least test the feature(s) of the volunteering team. This would force them to work together with the volunteering team, and they would need to get a better understanding of the feature(s) and the technology. There would be temporarily an extra Daily Scrum with the 3 people team and representatives of the volunteering team.
* *Start the 3 people team with one or two travelers (the LeSS Travelers guide) in the first Sprints from the volunteering team*<br/>One or two travelers per Sprint would join the 3-person team with the main purpose of teaching them the features and technologies used. They and the travelers would work closely together and do a lot of mob programming together. After each Sprint, they would evaluate the need for the upcoming Sprint and decide who would be the best volunteers to next travel to the team.

The volunteering team chose the last option and it seemed to work quite well. The 3-person team came up to speed in a couple of Sprints and traveling was not needed anymore. They retained a close relationship with the volunteering team for future questions and Sprints, when something wouldn’t be clear or when they needed help. This illustrates the LeSS coordination guide *Just Talk*, recognizing the under-appreciated power of *social bonds* in supporting collaboration. In one of the last Sprints with travelers, they also took support duty (the LeSS “fast-response team” covered in the LeSS guide *Handling Special Items*), to learn how that would work and have a broader overview of the product. One of the travelers said the Sprints he traveled to the new team were among the best Sprints he had worked in. In the subsequent months, more people were added to the team and most of the knowledge sharing was done by the original 3 people to the newly added people.

For the goal of adding capacity, this approach worked quite well. The team was experienced in product development and had a good mindset of working together (many of them already worked together in previous assignments). The conclusion to draw in this context is that adding a new team this way, gives sort of a quick onboarding and being able to work as other teams relatively fast. The biggest advantage of this learning approach is that the existing teams were not much influenced and kept working like they were used to (only two travelers had to leave their team for 2 Sprints). The biggest disadvantage is that there is a lot of focus on learning in the starting period, and not a more gradual approach. However, starting with 3 people seemed like a good balance between learning, being able to teach others afterwards and actually working on the product.
